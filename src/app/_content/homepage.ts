 * "SAEL Pan India Green Footprint" — section 4.
 *
 * **Rebuilt from `SAEL-Numbers and data.pdf` page 2 on 2026-08-27**, which the
 * client supplied as this section's data template. It replaces six *site*
 * pins — Bhadra, Greater Noida, Kishangarh, Jalore, Mizoram, Kurnool — with
 * the eleven **states** the client's own map labels, each carrying between one
 * and three figures. Kurnool's `{{TODO: content}}` goes with them; it was the
 * one pin the handover never corroborated.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * **The figures are the PDF's. Which legend each belongs to is derived, and
 * wants the client's confirmation.**
 *
 * The PDF marks every figure with an icon and decodes the four in a legend
 * strip under the map. Those icons do not survive at the resolution the file
 * gives us, so the assignment below was worked out from the totals the *same
 * document* prints on page 1, which is a stronger check than reading a 12px
 * glyph:
 *
 *  - **Agri waste-to-energy — exact.** 89.4 (Rajasthan) + 60.5 (Punjab) + 15
 *    (Haryana) = **164.9 MW**, page 1's figure to the decimal. Three values,
 *    one total, no slack: this is the assignment that fixes the other two.
 *  - **In-house module assembly — rounds.** 3400 (Rajasthan) + 225 (Punjab) +
 *    5000 (Uttar Pradesh) = 8625 MW → page 1's **8.6 GW**.
 *  - **Solar cell — named.** Page 1 puts the 5 GW cell capacity at *Jewar,
 *    Uttar Pradesh*, and Uttar Pradesh is the only state carrying a second
 *    5 GW here.
 *  - Everything left over is Solar IPP, which is also every single-figure
 *    state.
 *
 * **One thing does not reconcile, and it is the client's to answer, not ours.**
 * The Solar IPP figures sum to **9090 MW**, where page 1 of the same PDF says
 * **8.3 GWp** and `getCapacityStats()` returns 8299 MWp. No single value
 * accounts for the 791 MW gap, so it is not one misread icon — the map and the
 * headline look like different as-of dates. Both are reproduced as published
 * rather than reconciled here. /CLAUDE.md §3.
 *
 * Within a state the figures keep the order the PDF's own callout prints them
 * in. Uttar Pradesh's two are both "5 GW", so their order carries nothing.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Coordinates are points in the artwork's own 311.33 × 337.45 viewBox —
 * `src/assets/images/dotted-map.svg`, supplied by the client on 2026-08-21.
 *
 * **They are fitted, not measured.** The six site pins that preceded these
 * were themselves carried across from a previous 620 × 660 geometry rather
 * than measured (see sections/presence-map/dots.ts). Rather than start a
 * second, unrelated guess, a lon→x / lat→y linear fit was taken *from those
 * six* and the eleven state centroids pushed through it. The artwork turns out
 * to be a plain equirectangular projection and the fit is tight — five of the
 * six residuals are under one viewBox unit, the worst is 2.7, which is 0.9% of
 * the width. So these pins are no worse placed than the ones they replace,
 * which is not the same as saying either is right: **the map still wants an
 * eye before it ships.**
 *
 * `href` is absent throughout, so the design's "Visit Location" link does not
 * render. The destinations have not been supplied.
