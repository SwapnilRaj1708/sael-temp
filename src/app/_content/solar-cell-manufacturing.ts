/**
 * The Solar Cell Manufacturing page's static content.
 *
 * **Every string here is transcribed verbatim from the live
 * https://www.sael.co/solar-cell-manufacturing/**, read from its HTML on
 * 2026-09-19 with only its source whitespace collapsed — including its curly
 * apostrophes (`SAEL’s`, `India’s`). The client's reference screenshot fixed
 * the layout, not the copy. Same bargain as `solar-energy.ts`, which this
 * follows section for section.
 *
 * ## What the live page does not have
 *
 * **No portfolio figure.** The reference screenshot draws "5 GW" over a
 * "Portfolio" caption under the projects copy; the live page has no such
 * block — the 5 GW appears in the paragraph and on the map's one pin, and
 * "Portfolio" appears nowhere on the page. /CLAUDE.md §2 rule 3: nothing is
 * added, so `<ProjectsMap>` is given no `figure` here. Flagged for the client;
 * restoring it is one line once they confirm the caption.
 *
 * **No headings on the four highlights.** The live page sets them as four
 * bare paragraphs, and so does the screenshot. `<CapabilitySplit>` renders
 * them mark-and-copy only.
 *
 * ## The artwork
 *
 * All three photographs live in Azure Blob Storage under
 * `<container>/web-assets/media/solar-cell-manufacturing/`, supplied
 * 2026-09-21 and described by `cdnImage(path, width, height)` with
 * **dimensions read from the blobs themselves**. Only container-relative
 * paths are committed (/CLAUDE.md §7). The two masked slots take the same
 * `mask1`/`mask2` shapes as Solar Energy — both assets are opaque, so the
 * CSS mask does the cutting, unlike Module Manufacturing's, which arrives
 * pre-shaped. The map is the homepage's `dotted-map.svg`.
 *
 * **The hero is a photograph, not a video**, on the client's instruction of
 * 2026-09-21 — the one business page of the four without one. `<PageHero>`
 * needs nothing special for that: it draws the photograph whenever `video`
 * is absent, which is the About Us behaviour.
