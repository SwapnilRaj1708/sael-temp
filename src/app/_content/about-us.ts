/**
 * The About Us page's static content.
 *
 * Static rather than dynamic for the same reason the homepage's is: this is
 * corporate copy that changes with a review and a deploy, not with a database
 * row. docs/content-model.md §2.
 *
 * **Every string here is transcribed verbatim from `About Us.dc.html`**, the
 * client's Claude Design project, which in turn carries the copy from the live
 * https://www.sael.co/about-us/. /CLAUDE.md §2 rule 3: none of it is
 * paraphrased, and nothing that was missing has been invented.
 *
 * ## The artwork
 *
 * The fourteen assets live in Azure Blob Storage under
 * `<container>/web-assets/media/about-us/` and are described by
 * `cdnImage(path, width, height)` — see `src/lib/assets/cdn.ts` for why that
 * helper exists and what it returns.
 *
 * **They were committed to `src/assets/images/about-us/` until 2026-09-17**,
 * because a bundled import carries the intrinsic width and height
 * `next/image` needs and a bare URL does not. The client uploaded the folder
 * on that date, the local copies were deleted, and `cdnImage()` closes the gap
 * they left by carrying those dimensions itself. Nothing downstream changed:
 * every prop is still a `StaticImageData`.
 *
 * **The dimensions below were read from the blobs, not from the local copies.**
 * They are what the browser reserves before a byte arrives, so a wrong one is
 * a layout shift. Two were not what the deleted files said they were.
 *
 * **`about-us-hero.JPG` is the one uppercase name in the folder.** Azure Blob
 * names are case-sensitive and that is the only URL that resolves, so it is
 * spelled in upper case here. It still wants renaming on the CDN — it is the
 * odd one out and the tracker carries it — but nothing is blocked by it now
 * that Turbopack is no longer asked to bundle the file.
 *
 * The marks are joined to their cards by the page, not here: a `mark` is a
 * React node, and this file is data.
