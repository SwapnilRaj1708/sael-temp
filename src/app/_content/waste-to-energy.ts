/**
 * The Waste To Energy page's static content.
 *
 * **Every string here is transcribed verbatim from the live
 * https://www.sael.co/waste-to-energy/**, read from its HTML on 2026-09-19
 * with only its source whitespace collapsed — including its curly apostrophes
 * (`SAEL’s`), the en dash in the standfirst, and its own inconsistent casing
 * of "Waste-To-Energy" / "Waste-to-Energy" from one heading to the next. The
 * client's reference screenshot fixed the layout, not the copy. Follows
 * `solar-energy.ts` section for section.
 *
 * ## Where the screenshot and the live page disagree
 *
 * - **Six benefit cards, not four.** The screenshot's four identical cards are
 *   placeholder art; the live page has six distinct benefits and all six are
 *   carried.
 * - **The label reads "Why Waste-to-Energy?"** and the heading "Benefits of
 *   Waste-to-Energy", as the live page casts them; the screenshot capitalises
 *   "To".
 * - **The portfolio figure lands on 164.9 MW.** Live markup:
 *   `<span data-target="164">0</span><span>.9</span> MW` — the counter stops
 *   at 164 and the ".9" is static, so the settled figure is 164.9, which is
 *   also what the homepage ledger sets.
 * - **"More Details" on the Ferozepur and Jaitu pins** link to project-detail
 *   pages the new site does not have. Only "Visit Location" is carried.
 *
 * ## Two Bikaner pins
 *
 * The live page lists **Bikaner (Rajasthan) 14.9 MW twice**, with two
 * different Google Maps destinations — two plants in one district. Both are
 * carried as separate pins with distinct ids, placed a few units apart so
 * neither hides the other; which is which on the ground is not something the
 * page says.
 *
 * ## The artwork
 *
 * The hero video and the two masked photographs live in Azure Blob Storage
 * under `<container>/web-assets/media/waste-to-energy/`, supplied 2026-09-21.
 * The photographs are described by `cdnImage(path, width, height)` with
 * **dimensions read from the blobs themselves** — see `lib/assets/cdn.ts` for
 * why that matters — and the video by `tryBlobUrl()`, so only
 * container-relative paths are committed and no hostname enters the
 * repository (/CLAUDE.md §7). The hero poster is still `null`: with
 * `AZURE_BLOB_BASE_URL` unset, or before the first frame, the hero holds its
 * box as a placeholder. The shapes the photographs are clipped to are the
 * Solar Energy pair, carried as `--mask-solar-*` in theme.css. The map is the
 * homepage's `dotted-map.svg`.
