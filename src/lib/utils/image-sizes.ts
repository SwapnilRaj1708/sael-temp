/**
 * `sizes` hints for `next/image`, in one place.
 *
 * Every fill image must carry one — an unset `sizes` ships a 1920px asset to a
 * phone, and that is a build-review rejection. docs/design-guidelines.md §6,
 * docs/responsive-strategy.md §6.
 *
 * They live here rather than at the call sites for a narrow reason: a `sizes`
 * value is a list of *media conditions*, and viewport units are the only way
 * to express one. Everywhere else under `src/`, a `vw` is banned outright and
 * `pnpm verify:guardrails` enforces it — a proportional unit is not a
 * responsive one (docs/responsive-strategy.md §1). This module is the single
 * exemption, which keeps that rule absolute in every file where it means
 * something, and confines the exception to eight lines that contain no layout.
 *
 * These describe the *rendered* width of the image, not the asset's size.
