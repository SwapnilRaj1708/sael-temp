/**
 * The site footer. A Server Component; only the accordions inside
 * `<FooterLinks>` are client.
 *
 * Two deviations from `docs/features/03-app-shell-header-footer.md` §3, both
 * decided on 2026-08-04 and recorded in docs/asset-inventory.md:
 *
 *  - **The logo sits on a white plate.** No white variant of the mark exists,
 *    and the colour logo is a purple→red gradient over a black strapline, so
 *    it cannot go straight onto `--color-footer-bg`. Rather than set the
 *    wordmark as text — which loses the mark entirely — the real artwork gets
 *    its own light surface. Decided with the client on 2026-08-05.
 *  - **No background image.** `footer-background.jpg` was not in the client
 *    handover, so the flat token colour stands in. `responsive-strategy.md` §4
 *    already sanctions this below md; it now applies at every width, which
 *    also means the copy's contrast is predictable rather than dependent on
 *    an image crop.
 *
 * The corporate block is present on the live site but not the prototype. §3
 * says include it, and it is legally useful.
 *
 * **`data-snap-section` makes it the last stop on a snapping page.** It is the
 * same attribute every homepage section carries, and it is inert everywhere
 * else — globals.css scopes both snap rules to `html:has([data-snap-sections])`,
 * which only the homepage renders. The footer became a snap target on
 * 2026-08-27, when the client asked for the page to behave the same from top
 * to bottom; the tail scrolled normally before that. See the comment above the
 * rules in globals.css.
