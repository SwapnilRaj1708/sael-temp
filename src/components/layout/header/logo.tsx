/**
 * The masthead logo, linking home.
 *
 * A raster by decision on 2026-08-04 — the client has not supplied the vector,
 * and `docs/asset-inventory.md` §4 records the swap as outstanding. The
 * committed master is 1600px wide against a 42px rendered height, so it stays
 * sharp; `sizes` is set from the rendered height rather than left to default,
 * or `next/image` would ship the full-width asset to a phone.
 *
 * The `alt` is the company name, not "SAEL logo". It is the site's home link,
 * and a screen reader announcing "link, SAEL logo" says one word too many.
 * The strapline is baked into the artwork, so it is not repeated in text.
