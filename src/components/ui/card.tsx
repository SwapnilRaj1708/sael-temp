/**
 * The v2 card: a hairline, an inset under it, and an accent that fills across
 * the hairline when the card is hovered or focused. docs/design-guidelines.md §4.
 *
 * **This primitive was rewritten on 2026-08-26 (C-1) to match the built
 * homepage**, which is authoritative. It previously described the pre-v2 card —
 * a white box with `--radius-card`, a border on all four sides,
 * `--shadow-card-hover` and a 5px lift — plus a `tile` variant that wrapped its
 * children in `<TileShape>` for the chamfered business tile. v2 removed both
 * surfaces: the news card "lost its box" and the business tiles became rows of
 * a ledger. Neither variant had a single call site, so the old spec survived
 * only here and in the guidelines, describing a page that no longer existed.
 *
 * What is shared is smaller than the old primitive but real: the two sections
 * had the same six-line accent span duplicated verbatim, and the same
 * `group relative flex w-full border-t` spine underneath it. That trio —
 * hairline, inset, accent — *is* the v2 card idiom, and it is what a new page
 * should reach for.
 *
 * Deliberately **not** in here: flex direction, the column gap, and the one
 * upcoming row's own ground. Those are each section's composition, and pushing
 * them into variants would make this a switch statement over two callers rather
 * than a primitive.
 *
 * The accent is `scaleX` from a left origin, so nothing is laid out again per
 * frame, and it is `aria-hidden` — it repeats the hover state a focus ring
 * already carries. `group-has-focus-visible` mirrors `group-hover`
 * throughout, so a card reached by keyboard behaves as it does under a pointer.
 * docs/responsive-strategy.md §5.
 *
 * **It was `group-focus-within` until FE-07, and that was a bug.** A card whose
 * content opens a modal — the team card's biography dialog — gets focus back on
 * its trigger when the dialog closes, because that is what a native `<dialog>`
 * correctly does. `:focus-within` cannot tell that restored focus from a
 * deliberate keyboard visit, so the accent stayed filled after a mouse user
 * closed the dialog, and stayed filled while they moved the pointer over other
 * cards. `:has(:focus-visible)` defers to the browser's own modality
 * heuristic instead: after a pointer interaction the ring is not drawn and
 * neither is the accent, and after a keyboard one both are — which is right,
 * because a keyboard user does need to see where focus landed.
 *
 * **`shape="outlined"` is the second card idiom**, added 2026-09-17 to the
 * client's reference for the strategic pillars: a rounded box outlined on all
 * four sides, with its content set inside `--spacing-flow` of padding. It
 * keeps the same `group` and ground so the accent and the hover contract are
 * unchanged; only the frame differs. The hairline idiom stays the default.
 *
 * **Hover light — an Aceternity UI trial, client request of 2026-09-25.**
 * Every card of each idiom gets the same light on hover, so the client can
 * judge the effect across the whole site rather than on one page: an
 * outlined card gets `<BackgroundGradient>`, and a hairline card with an
 * accent gets `<DottedGlowBackground>`. A touch screen has no hover, so
 * `<TouchLight>` lights a card on a tap instead. A hairline card with no accent is
 * not interactive and gets neither, for the reason it has no accent. The
 * light is a layer at `z-index: -1` inside a card that isolates, so it sits
 * above the card's own ground and below all of its content with nothing
 * asked of the children. Pass `hoverEffect={false}` to exempt one card; to
 * take the trial out, delete the two layers below and their components.
