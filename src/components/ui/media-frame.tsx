/**
 * An image slot that renders correctly whether or not the image exists yet.
 *
 * Most of the homepage's artwork has not been supplied — `src/assets/images/`
 * holds four navigation thumbnails and the logo, and nothing else.
 * docs/asset-inventory.md §9 lists what is outstanding. Rather than block the
 * whole component layer on a set of JPEGs, or invent substitutes for them, an
 * absent image renders as a neutral block that **holds the exact same box** as
 * the real one will.
 *
 * That distinction is the point. The frame is always laid out by its parent,
 * never by its content, so aspect ratio, reflow, the 360px overflow check and
 * cumulative layout shift are all genuinely exercised now, and binding the
 * real asset later is a one-line data change with no layout consequence.
 *
 * The placeholder is deliberately unmistakable rather than decorative — a flat
 * token colour, no shimmer, no icon. It should never read as a design choice
 * that someone might leave in. `data-pending` carries the asset's name from
 * docs/asset-inventory.md so it is identifiable in devtools without shipping
 * a visible label to users.
 *
 * Delete this primitive's placeholder branch once every asset has landed; the
 * `image` prop can then narrow from `StaticImageData | null` to
 * `StaticImageData` and TypeScript will find every call site that still cares.
