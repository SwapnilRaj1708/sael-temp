/**
 * A grid of faint cells that light under the pointer and ripple outward from
 * a click — Aceternity UI's "Background Ripple Effect", at the client's
 * request of 2026-09-29. Decorative: it fills its positioned parent, and the
 * content goes on top.
 *
 * **What is Aceternity's, and what is not.**
 *
 *  - Theirs: the grid, the cell (hairline border, faint fill, inset glow),
 *    the rest and lit opacities, the hover, and the click wave — every cell
 *    lighting after a delay and for a time that both grow with its distance
 *    from the cell clicked, restarted by remounting the grid.
 *  - Coloured here, not by them. Their cells are neutral grey; these are
 *    drawn in neutral light and tinted by one layer across the whole band —
 *    `--gradient-heading-bright` in `mix-blend-mode: color` — so the grid
 *    runs violet to magenta to red left to right, the ramp the site's dark
 *    headings use. The tint acts on true black inside this box, and the box
 *    is laid onto the page with `screen`, so the page's own ground shows
 *    through where the grid is dark — animations.css (`.ripple-band`) says
 *    why a direct blend over the site's near-black washes the whole band.
 *    It adds light, so it is for a dark ground only, like the site.
 *  - Sized here, not by them. Their grid is a fixed 27 × 8 box whose fade is
 *    measured against itself; this one is wider than any screen, centred,
 *    clipped to its parent, and faded against the parent — so the fade lands
 *    on the screen at every width. Cells are 44px on a phone, 56px (theirs)
 *    at the design width.
 *  - Timing and colour live in tokens (`--ripple-*`, theme.css) and in
 *    animations.css; the script's only job is to say which cell was clicked
 *    and how far every other cell is from it.
 *
 * **One click handler for the grid**, not one per cell: the cell under the
 * pointer is worked out from the grid's own box. Hover is pure CSS.
 *
 * `aria-hidden` and never focusable — it is a background. A click on it does
 * nothing but ripple. Under reduced motion the wave does not run; the hover
 * still lights a cell, without the fade (animations.css).
