/**
 * A Multimedia card's action: the video, played in a dialog, loaded only
 * when asked for.
 *
 * **A click-to-load facade.** The card shows YouTube's thumbnail, served
 * through `next/image`, and no player. The iframe exists only while the
 * dialog is open, so a listing of thirteen videos loads no YouTube script
 * and sets no Google cookie until a visitor presses play — and then only
 * for that one video, from `youtube-nocookie.com`. Closing the dialog
 * unmounts the iframe, which is also what stops the sound.
 *
 * **A dialog rather than playing inline**, for three reasons. A card in a
 * three- or four-column grid is ~330px wide, which is a poor size to watch
 * anything at; the dialog plays at up to 1152px, and never taller than the
 * screen. Only one player can exist at a time, so two videos cannot play over
 * each other and nothing has to coordinate them. And a native `<dialog>`
 * opened with `showModal()` does the accessibility work correctly for free —
 * focus moves into it, it is trapped there, Escape closes it, and focus
 * returns to this button — which is why `<BioDisclosure>` uses one too. The
 * legacy site opened a lightbox, so this is also the behaviour returning
 * visitors expect.
 *
 * **Autoplay only because the visitor just pressed play**, and never under
 * `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` — then the player loads paused and waits
 * for a second, deliberate press.
 *
 * **Without JavaScript** the action is a plain link to the video's YouTube
 * page. It is rendered that way on the server and becomes a button only
 * once hydrated, so the card is never a button that does nothing.
