/**
 * A silent, looping, background video that holds the same box whether or
 * not it plays.
 *
 * **Decorative by contract.** This is for a moving backdrop under copy — the
 * Solar Energy and Careers heroes — not for a video that *is* the content.
 * It has no controls and no captions track, and it is `aria-hidden`,
 * because everything it would say is said by the heading and standfirst
 * laid over it. A video that carries meaning needs controls and a
 * transcript, and is a different component. An asset with speech in it does
 * not belong here at all: `muted` would silence what it has to say.
 *
 * **Reduced motion gets the poster, not a paused video.** `autoPlay` cannot
 * be gated by a media query in markup, so the choice is made here: the
 * still is rendered on the server and for anyone who prefers reduced motion,
 * and the `<video>` replaces it only once the client knows the preference
 * allows movement. /CLAUDE.md §5.
 *
 * **The poster is what paints; the video arrives behind it.** Three things
 * keep a multi-megabyte file off the critical path (2026-09-22):
 *
 *  - The `<video>` is never in the server HTML. It mounts after hydration,
 *    so the poster — a `priority` `next/image` — is the largest contentful
 *    paint and the file is not competing with the page's own assets for the
 *    first bytes.
 *  - It is drawn at zero opacity until the browser reports it is actually
 *    `playing`, then fades in over `--duration-media-fade`. Until then the
 *    poster shows through. This also covers a browser that refuses to
 *    autoplay at all — iOS in Low Power Mode, a data-saver setting — where
 *    the old build showed a frozen first frame or a black box, and this one
 *    shows the poster indefinitely, which is the correct still.
 *  - It pauses when scrolled out of view and resumes when scrolled back,
 *    so a hero that is off screen is not decoding 1080p frames nobody sees.
 *
 * `muted` is what lets a browser autoplay at all; `playsInline` keeps iOS
 * from taking it full screen; `preload="metadata"` fetches enough to size
 * and start, not the whole file up front. Picture-in-picture and remote
 * playback are switched off because a decorative loop has no business in
 * either.
