/**
 * The v2 section heading — `--text-display` with a gradient clipped to the
 * letterforms. docs/design-guidelines.md §4.
 *
 * **The ramp follows the ground, and that is the whole reason this exists.**
 * `--gradient-eyebrow-deep` on paper, `--gradient-heading-bright` on black.
 * Getting the pair wrong is the fastest way for a new section to look
 * off-system, and it is not something a call site can be relied on to
 * remember — note in particular that the dark heading takes
 * `--gradient-heading-bright`, *not* `--gradient-eyebrow-bright`, which is a
 * different ramp belonging to the label above it.
 *
 * Extracted 2026-08-26 (**C-2**) from `intro-split`, `solutions-carousel` and
 * `presence-map`, which had written the same three classes out by hand.
 *
 * **Deliberately not props:** the measure cap (`max-w-(--hero-measure)`) and
 * the top margin (`mt-stack`). Both vary across the three call sites because
 * they depend on what the heading sits beside — a cap keeps it clear of a
 * column, a margin spaces it under a label — and neither is a property of the
 * heading itself. They stay in `className`.
 *
 * This is **not** `ui/section-heading.tsx`, and the two are not alternatives.
 * That primitive renders eyebrow → title → description as one block, which is
 * what a page outside the homepage's reveal cascade wants. A homepage section
 * wraps each of those in its own `<Reveal order={n}>` so they arrive one after
 * another, so it needs the heading on its own — which is this.
