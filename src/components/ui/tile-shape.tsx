/**
 * The chamfered business-tile surface — a rectangle with its bottom-right
 * corner cut away.
 *
 * **Drawn in CSS. Do not import `rtile-*.svg`.** Those files are a single path
 * with `preserveAspectRatio="none"`, so stretching one to a tall mobile tile
 * turns its corner radii into ellipses, and its `fill` is hardcoded where a
 * token belongs. docs/asset-inventory.md §4.
 *
 * Known limitation, called out in that document: `clip-path` and
 * `border-radius` do not compose on every engine. Where they do not, the
 * corners render square and the chamfer still reads correctly — an acceptable
 * degradation, and the reason the radius is applied rather than baked into the
 * polygon. The final call belongs to the FE-04 design review.
