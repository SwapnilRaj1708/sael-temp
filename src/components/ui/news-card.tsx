 * The news card — the homepage "In the News" rail's card, pulled out on
 * 2026-10-01 so the Newsroom builds all four of its card types from it
 * rather than drawing a second card.
 *
 * **The card lost its box** in `SAEL Home v2`, and this keeps it that way: a
 * hairline across the top, the date above the image rather than on it, a
 * thumbnail, the headline, and the action at the base. The card is defined
 * by the rule it hangs from and its own alignment, not by an outline; the
 * accent fills across that rule on hover. All of that is `<Card>`'s — this
 * component is the news card's *contents*, in the order the design sets.
 *
 * **Four variants, one card:**
 *
 *  - `ground` — `paper` is the homepage rail; `dark` is the Newsroom, which
 *    sits on the investor template's black. Date, headline, the image's
 *    empty frame and the action follow it; the shape does not change.
 *  - `layout` — `stack` always stands up, as the homepage's fixed-width
 *    rail cards do. `adaptive` is a **row** while its grid is one column —
 *    the thumbnail at `--news-row-thumb-w` on the left, the rest beside it —
 *    and stands up from the grid's `@2xl` container width. The breakpoint is
 *    the *grid's* width, not the screen's, because a listing beside the
 *    area's side list is narrower than the screen by that list.
 *  - `media` — `photo` is the 5:4 thumbnail; `video` is 16:9, the frame a
 *    YouTube thumbnail is cut for.
 *  - The date is **optional in the props**, not hidden: an item with no
 *    `publishedAt` renders no `<time>` at all. Our Views and Multimedia
 *    carry none.
 *
 * The action is a slot — `<NewsCardLink>` for an article or an outbound
 * piece, `<YouTubeDialog>` for a video — and whichever fills it stretches its
 * hit area over the whole card with `after:inset-0`, so the image and the
 * headline are clickable while the accessible name stays the action's own.
 *
 * **The headline clamps to three lines.** These run from eight words to
 * thirty-five, and left alone the tallest sets the height of a whole row.
 * `line-clamp` truncates visually and leaves the full string in the
 * accessibility tree and in the page text. It needs no `overflow-hidden` of
 * its own — it is `-webkit-box` clamping, which already hides the overflow,
 * and adding one would clip the focus ring on the action below.
 *
 * A Server Component.
