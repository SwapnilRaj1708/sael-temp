 * A frame whose border lights up and sweeps once round as its section

 *
 * Three boxes, all on the same radius: a halo behind the panel, the panel
 * itself, and a one-pixel ring over the panel's border. The wrapper carries
 * the radius and the children fill it, so the ring drawn at `inset: 0` sits
 * exactly on the border of whatever is inside — the alignment the pasted
 * effect of 2026-09-22 lacked, because it drew its own box at its own radius
 * around a card that had another.
 *
 * **Both behaviours drive the same two custom properties**, `--glow-angle`
 * and `--glow-edge`, which the ring and halo read in animations.css.
 *
 *  - **The sweep is CSS.** Two keyframe animations, gated on the
 *    `data-reveal="shown"` attribute the enclosing `<Reveal>` sets and
 *    clears, so it plays on first arrival and every return, and is inert
 *    under reduced motion.
 *  - **The hover follow is the one thing that needs JavaScript**, and it is
 *    why this is a client component: the pointer's angle from the panel's
 *    centre and its closeness to an edge are written straight to the two
 *    properties as inline styles — a runtime value carried into CSS, the
 *    use of `style` /CLAUDE.md §5 allows — with no React state and no
 *    re-render per move. It is attached only where a pointer can hover
 *    (`hover: hover` and `pointer: fine`), so a phone never sees a half-lit
 *    frame after a tap, and not under reduced motion, the same gate the
 *    hero's parallax takes.
 *
 * While the sweep runs, the animation's values win over the inline ones;
 * once it ends the inline values apply, which is why the keyframes fill
 * `backwards` rather than `both` — a forward fill would pin the properties
 * at the sweep's end state and the pointer could never move them.
 *
 * The two light layers are decorative and `aria-hidden`. Must be rendered
 * inside a `<Reveal>` for the sweep; outside one only the hover applies.
