/**
 * "About SAEL" — the label, a display heading and running copy, beside the
 * composite artwork. docs/features/04 §3, rebuilt to `SAEL Home v2`.
 *
 * **A grid now, not a stage.** The previous build placed four elements inside
 * a fixed 1280:528 box as percentages, because that is how
 * `SAEL - New Website.pdf` draws the section — the heading and the body are
 * not columns there, they are two differently-inset blocks beside the
 * artwork. v2 abandons that for a plain twelve-column grid: label, heading and
 * body stack in one column, the artwork sits in the other, and the whole
 * `--about-*` coordinate set went with the stage.
 *
 * **The pair is pulled in off the gutters.** v2 sets the copy at columns 1–6
 * and the artwork at 8–12, which leaves the two ends of the section heavy and
 * a whole empty column down the middle. At the client's request on 2026-08-21
 * they are drawn together instead — copy on 2–6, artwork on 7–12, no empty
 * column between them. It was 7–11 and symmetric until 2026-08-25; the note on
 * the artwork says what bought the twelfth column and what it cost.
 *
 * **There is no rule above the body any more**, by the client's decision on
 * 2026-08-25. It used to separate the display heading from the running copy,
 * on the argument that the two would otherwise read as one block of text at
 * two sizes; the client's call is that the heading's own size and ramp already
 * do that, and the rule was buying the separation at the price of a `--flow`
 * of padding on either side of it. The gap is a single `--flow` now, and the
 * height the column gave back is spent on the artwork — see the note there.
 *
 * Below `lg` the grid collapses to ordinary flow — heading, artwork, body —
 * per docs/responsive-strategy.md §4.
 *
 * **The artwork is three layers assembled here, not one supplied image —
 * again, as of 2026-09-01.** It was assembled in the browser once before, then
 * replaced by a single graded PNG on the argument that a browser can
 * approximate a duotone but never match it. The client has since supplied the
 * layers separately, so it is assembled again, and the objection is answered
 * rather than dodged: the grade is a `multiply` of --gradient-shape over a
 * desaturated, lifted photograph, and the figures were fitted against
 * `aboutSael/sardar-kid-cutout.png` — the composite that was approved, kept
 * as the reference for the arrangement. Not for the colour, since 2026-09-02:
 * the shape now arrives as `aboutSael/mask.svg` carrying its own ramp, which
 * is brighter and bluer than the composite's, and that file wins.
 *
 * **Nothing in the assembly is a length.** The shape is a proportion of the
 * artwork box, the cut-out is a proportion of the shape, and the shape's
 * ratio is what decides how far down its top edge falls. So the arrangement
 * is the same picture at 360px as at 1920px, and there is no breakpoint
 * anywhere in it. docs/responsive-strategy.md §3.

            Six columns, where it used to take five. The client asked on
            2026-08-25 for the artwork to take up the room the rule above the
            body gave back, and a column is the only place that room can come
            from: the artwork is `w-full` of its column and always has been, so
            it is the *grid* that sizes it, not `--about-media-max-w` —
            measured at four widths, the cap was never once the binding
            constraint. Raising the cap would have moved nothing.

            The sixth column is the spare one at the right-hand end, not one
            taken off the copy. Taking it off the copy was tried first and
            keeps the client's 2026-08-21 symmetry — a spare column outside
            each half — but it costs the body 100px at 1440 and leaves it 284px
            wide at `lg`, well inside `--ledger-measure` and visibly ragged.
            The artwork's own transparent margin means it does not read as
            flush against the gutter even though its box now reaches it, so the

                `isolate` is load-bearing. The grade is a `multiply` of
                --gradient-shape over the picture, and without a stacking
                context of its own that blend would reach through to the
                section's paper ground and tint the page behind the shape.
                The mask would in fact establish one on its own; saying so
                explicitly is cheaper than relying on that.

                The photograph is desaturated and lifted before the ramp
                multiplies over it — grade the colour that is there and the
                result muddies, and the lift is what stops `multiply` reading
