/**
 * "Our Ambition" — the client's cut-out composition of 2026-09-17: a shaped
 * paper panel carrying the copy, and a cut-out portrait standing against its
 * right edge. One panel from `md`, a taller one below.
 *
 * **Two layouts, one section.** Below `md` it is the client's mobile
 * reference: a tall panel notched at the top-right, the copy running down
 * its body, and the portrait standing on its bottom-right foot and
 * overhanging the edge. From `md` it is the wide panel. They are siblings
 * toggled by `md:hidden` / `md:flex` rather than one layout bent to do both,
 * because each panel's geometry is its artwork's and does not reflow;
 * /CLAUDE.md §8 draws the same line for the vision timeline. Each carries
 * its own `--cutout-*` fractions, the mobile set prefixed `--cutout-m-`.
 *
 * **The panel is the container's width, less a right inset, and the section
 * is as tall as that makes it.** The inset (`--cutout-panel-inset-r`) is what
 * lets the portrait, anchored bottom-right of the block, stand proud of the
 * panel's edge, with its head rising into the room the heading leaves above.
 * The client set the desktop composition by hand on 2026-09-17 and it is the
 * approved one; the earlier width caps and viewport-height budgets are gone.
 *
 * **The copy is a display statement, not running text.** It is set in
 * `--text-cutout-copy`, which runs from 18px at the `md` floor to 36px at the
 * design width so it scales with the panel it sits on — the client's ask.
 *
 * **Everything on the panel is a fraction of the panel.** The notch, the
 * shelf and the portrait's stance are read off the SVG path and minted as
 * `--cutout-*` tokens in theme.css, so the copy stays on the paper as the
 * panel scales. The panel is a `next/image` with `h-auto` rather than a CSS
 * background, so it sizes itself from its own aspect ratio and the positioned
 * layers follow.
 *
 * **The heading is the section's, not the panel's.** It sits at the top of
 * the block against the container's left edge, exactly where "Our Strategic
 * Pillars" and "Our Guiding Principles" put theirs, with the panel directly
 * beneath it; the client's ruling of 2026-09-17, after a cut that set it in
 * the panel's notch.
 *
 * The panel's own dot texture is baked into the SVG and is the same paper
 * ground as `ground-dots-paper`, so the copy on it is set in `--color-ink`.
 *
 * **Both panels are SVG and are rendered `unoptimized`.** They come from the
 * blob container, and Next's optimizer refuses a remote SVG unless
 * `dangerouslyAllowSVG` is set — which it is not, and should not be. The Next
 * docs recommend `unoptimized` for vectors in any case: there is nothing in a
 * path to resample. It also makes `sizes` meaningless, so neither panel
 * carries one; the portrait is a PNG and still does.
 *
 * **A missing container degrades to the prose split.** `cdnImage()` returns
 * `null` when `AZURE_BLOB_BASE_URL` is unset, and the copy on the panel is
 * near-black — drawn on the section's own ground with no paper under it, it
 * would be invisible rather than merely unstyled. So the composition is
 * abandoned wholesale and the pre-cutout layout renders in its place, which is
 * legible on black and needs no artwork to be so.
 *
 * A Server Component. Nothing here is interactive.
