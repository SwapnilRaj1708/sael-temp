/**
 * The investor page template: trail, title, body, and the area's pages.
 *
 * **Built with Offer Documents to be what every investor page is built on**
 * — Financials & Reports and its five sub-pages, Corporate Governance,
 * Notifications. It is the About Us template's counterpart for document
 * pages, and it differs from it on purpose.
 *
 * **No banner photograph.** `<PageHero>` is a full screen of image with the
 * title at its foot; on a page whose whole purpose is one PDF, that puts the
 * PDF a screen below the fold on every device. This opens the way Our Team
 * does — trail and `<h1>` on the dotted black ground — and the document is on
 * the first screen at 360px. It is also closer to the legacy page, whose
 * header is a short band with the title in it, not a photograph.
 *
 * **The area's pages on the left from `lg`**, as on the legacy site — the
 * client's call of 2026-09-29, reversing this template's first layout, which
 * put them on the right. Below `lg` they follow the content.
 *
 * **In the source, the content still comes first.** The grid places the list
 * in the left column; the DOM does not move it. On a phone, and to a screen
 * reader everywhere, the document comes before eight links to other pages —
 * which is the order a reader who came for the document needs. The cost is
 * at `lg` and up, where Tab reaches the content before the list beside it on
 * the left; the content is still reached first, which is the point.
 *
 * **No breadcrumb on the Offer Documents pages** since 2026-09-29, the
 * client's call. The trail is still built in their content file and renders
 * again if a page passes it: Home › Investors › Offer Documents › this page,
 * with its own `BreadcrumbList`. Without it the side list and the header's
 * Investors menu are the way around the area.
 *
 * `spacing="closing"` — the page's last section meets the footer's pixel
 * strip, and the standard rhythm is too little room there.
 *
 * No `-mt-header`: nothing here is full-bleed, so the masthead offsets the
 * page exactly as `<main>`'s padding already arranges. With
 * `masthead="ripple"` the band is full-bleed but still starts under the bar.
 *
 * `overflow-x-clip` on the body's section: a `<GlowFrame>` halo reaches past
 * its card, and on a phone past the screen's edge — a horizontal scroll even
 * while it is unlit. `clip`, not `hidden`, so it creates no scroll container
 * and a sticky consent bar inside still sticks.
 *
 * A Server Component. What is interactive inside `children` brings its own
 * client leaf.
