/**
 * "Solutions" — the plants themselves, on a rail. docs/features/04 §6, rebuilt
 * to `SAEL Home v2`.
 *
 * **Four plates on a strip, not one card spanning the content width.** The
 * earlier build put a single 19:10 photograph across the page with its
 * neighbours bleeding past the gutters, and a gradient plaque laid over each.
 * v2 sets four 4:3 plates a hairline apart, each named underneath rather than
 * over: a `<figure>` with a real `<figcaption>` above the fold of the frame.
 * The plaque is gone with the composition that needed it, and so is the
 * section's licence to be taller than a screen — four smaller plates fit.
 *
 * **On black, where the design draws it.** It was built on paper by the
 * client's call on 2026-08-20 — the dark ground reserved for the Business
 * Portfolio and Our Goals, this section keeping company with the light ones
 * either side of it so the page did not alternate on every scroll. That call
 * was withdrawn on 2026-08-26, along with the one that put this section ahead
 * of Our Endeavour: the client's section sequence names this ground Black and
 * restores v2's own order, which gives the page back its alternation.
 *
 * Nothing about the flip is bespoke. Every ramp here is the declared dark
 * counterpart of the paper token it replaced, so no token was minted for it.
 * docs/homepage-section-sequence-review.md §5.2 has the pairing table.
 *
 * A Server Component, apart from the rail's arrows. The photography, the
 * captions and the heading block are all rendered here and handed to
 * {@link RailTrack} as children, so making the arrows interactive costs the
 * client bundle the arrows and nothing else — no image data, no copy.

              `--text-display`, which carries its own 400 weight — the same
              size and face as "Endeavoring to make a sustainable impact" and
              "Our Current Power Portfolio", which is how v2 sets all three.
              DIN has no 500, and asking for one would be synthesised.
              docs/design-guidelines.md §2.

              The ramp is clipped to the letterforms, as the design has it.
              `ground="dark"` resolves to `--gradient-heading-bright`, which is
              the heading's own on-black ramp and *not*
              `--gradient-eyebrow-bright` — that one belongs to the label above
              it. The primitive keeps the two straight; writing the classes by
              hand is where they get crossed.

              **The heading has the row to itself**, by the client's decision
              on 2026-08-25. It used to share a line with the sentence that
              qualifies it, which is why it carried a 15ch cap — the cap was
              there to keep it clear of the column beside it. There is no
              column beside it now, so the cap is gone with the arrangement
              that needed it and the heading runs the content width.

                Stacked below `md`, where a sentence and a pair of 52px

                `md` rather than the page's usual `lg` hinge because this row
                is no longer competing with the heading for width: it has the
                whole content column, and a tablet has room for both halves
                long before it has room for the old three-part arrangement.
