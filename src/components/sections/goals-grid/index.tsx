/**
 * "Our Goals" — Mission, Vision and Ethos as three photographic cards.
 * docs/features/04 §10, rebuilt to `SAEL Home v2`.
 *
 * Three cards a hairline apart inside a hairline frame, on the black ground.
 * The 1px gaps are the grid's own background showing through, which is what
 * draws the rules between cards without any card owning a border its
 * neighbour also owns.
 *
 * **The resting state shows the photograph as it is.** That is the client's
 * call on 2026-08-20 and it is a change from both the design file and the
 * build before it, each of which laid a permanent scrim over the image. At
 * rest a card is its photograph, its mark and its name, centred; the scrim and
 * the description both arrive with the pointer.
 *
 * **The pointer opens the card rather than swapping its face.** Until
 * 2026-08-25 the mark and the name faded out as the description faded in, in
 * the same place — two states cross-fading, so at the halfway point the card
 * showed neither clearly. The client asked for the earlier build's movement
 * back, keeping the current marks: the mark and the name are carried *upward*
 * and stay legible, a rule appears under them, and the description rises into
 * the space that opens below it. Nothing is exchanged for anything; the card
 * simply has more in it. How the height is animated without a magic number is
 * the note on the panel itself.
 *
 * Which leaves the mark and the name sitting on an untreated photograph, so
 * they carry `--shadow-goal-title` rather than leaning on a scrim that is not
 * there. Two of the three backgrounds are bright enough that they would
 * otherwise be unreadable — the orange one especially, where white on that
 * orange is about 2:1.
 *
 * Everything hover-driven is gated on `(hover: hover)`. A touch device cannot
 * hover, and a card whose description is behind an interaction nobody can
 * perform is a card with no description. There the scrim is simply on and both
 * states are stacked and visible, which is the arrangement the design draws.
 *
 * The photographs carry meaning only by association, so they are decorative:
 * each card's title and body say everything the card means, and describing
 * "a close-up of green leaves" to a screen-reader user adds noise, not
 * information. Hence `alt=""` and no `alt` on the interface.
 *
 * A Server Component. Nothing here is interactive.

                    A row fraction and not a height, because there is no height
                    to write down — the body runs to a different number of
                    lines in each of the three cards and at every width, and
                    `max-height: 20rem` would make all three animate at a
                    different apparent speed and clip whichever one outgrew the
                    guess. `0fr → 1fr` is the element's own height, animated,
                    with nothing to keep in step.

                    It is also what pushes the mark and the name up. The column
                    is `justify-center`, so the panel taking height moves
                    everything above it by half of that height, at exactly the
                    rate the panel opens. Nothing has to be told how far to
                    travel.

                    way everything else in this card is arranged: a touch
                    device cannot hover, and a description behind an
                    interaction nobody can perform is a description nobody
                    reads.
