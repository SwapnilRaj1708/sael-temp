 * and "Published On: …" beside the image, with the body below.
 *
 * - **The section's name is a link to its listing**, as the legacy "Press
 *   Release" button was — the way back from an article, since the page has
 *   no breadcrumb.
 * - **The date is absent, not empty**, on an Our Views piece, which has none.
 * - **The image is decorative here** (`alt=""`), as on the legacy page: it is
 *   the card's picture, and the headline it illustrates is the `<h1>` right
 *   above it. 16:9, which is what nearly all of them are (700 × 394); the
 *   few that are not lose a sliver to `object-cover` rather than leaving bars.
 * - **The body is set by `article-prose`** (globals.css) in the reading
 *   column `<SubPage layout="article">` provides.
 *
 * A Server Component.
