/**
 * A heading, a line or two of copy and one action, centred in a lit panel —
 * the Careers page's "Looking for your dream job?".
 *
 * The live page draws this as a full-width band, which at 1920 puts three
 * short lines across 1608px of ground. The panel is capped at
 * `--panel-max-w` and centred instead, so the copy and its button read as
 * one object with the ground around it.
 *
 * It is the outlined `<Card>` the strategic pillars and the "Why Join" points
 * take, lit two ways because this is the one panel on the page that asks the
 * reader to *do* something: a glow (`--gradient-panel-glow`) rising from the
 * top edge into the black ground, and — the client's ask of 2026-09-22 — a
 * `<GlowFrame>` whose border lights up and sweeps once round the panel each
 * time the section reveals. The block padding is a section's tight rhythm
 * rather than a card's inset, so the panel reads as a band with room around
 * its button.
 *
 * Dark only: the site is a dark site (docs/design-guidelines.md §8) and the
 * client asked on 2026-09-22 for this page to be dark throughout.
 *
 * Content-agnostic: the heading, the paragraphs and the action are props.
 * A Server Component — the sweep is CSS, keyed off `<Reveal>`'s attribute.
