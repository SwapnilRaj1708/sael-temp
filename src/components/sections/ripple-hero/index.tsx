 * A band across the top half of the screen with the page title centred in
 * it, over `<BackgroundRipple>` — the client's replacement, on 2026-09-29,
 * for the legacy Offer Documents banner, whose title also sat centred in a
 * violet-to-red band. It opens all nine Offer Documents pages, each with its
 * own title: "Offer Documents" on the index, the page's name on the rest.
 *
 * Titles run from two words to seven ("Information with respect to Group
 * Companies"), so the band is a minimum height, not a fixed one: a long
 * title on a narrow phone grows it rather than overflowing it, and the grid
 * behind is tall enough to fill it either way.
 *
 * **Full-bleed**, so the Section renders no Container and the copy carries
 * its own. **No `<Reveal>`**: it is above the fold on arrival, as
 * `<PageHero>` is, and content that animates in when it was already on
 * screen reads as a glitch.
 *
 * **The grid stays live under the title.** The copy is `pointer-events:
 * none`, so hovering across the title still lights the cells behind it and a
 * click there still ripples; only the breadcrumb's links take the pointer
 * back. The price is that the title cannot be selected with a mouse, which a
 * two-word heading does not need.
 *
 * An optional breadcrumb sits centred above the title. The Offer Documents
 * pages pass none, at the client's request of 2026-09-29.
 *
 * The band is `--ripple-hero-h` tall — half the screen less the masthead,
 * cut by a quarter, and by 30% from `lg` (`--ripple-hero-h-lg`), the
 * client's call of 2026-09-30 so the content starts higher — starting under
 * the masthead, which `<main>` already offsets.
 *
 * The title sits below the band's centre by a quarter of the top padding
 * of the section under it (`--ripple-title-shift`), also the client's call of
 * 2026-09-30.
 *
 * A Server Component; `<BackgroundRipple>` is the client leaf.
