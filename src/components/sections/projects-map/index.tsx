/**
 * A heading over the dotted India map beside running copy and one large
 * figure — the Solar Energy page's "Projects" section.
 *
 * **Why this is not `<PresenceMap>` with a prop.** The two sections share the
 * artwork and nothing else. The homepage's column is a display heading, a
 * footprint caption and two counts; this one is two paragraphs and a
 * portfolio figure, under a heading that spans both columns. A `variant` on
 * `<PresenceMap>` would have been a switch over two unrelated compositions.
 * The shared half — the map, its pins and their hover/focus contract — was
 * extracted to `<PresenceMapFigure>` instead, and both sections compose their
 * own copy beside it. The legend is off here: a solar-only map would say
 * "Solar Energy Generation" beside every pin, which is the page's own title.
 *
 * **Map left, copy right, heading above both** — the client's reference.
 * Below `lg` the row stacks and the copy comes first, because it is first in
 * the DOM: the heading, the paragraphs and the figure are the section's
 * content, and the map is their illustration. `lg:flex-row-reverse` is what
 * puts the map on the left only once there is a left to put it on.
 *
 * The figure is `<CountUp>`, so it counts in on arrival and sits still under
 * `prefers-reduced-motion`. Its colour is the page's business's own accent,
 * the same one its figures take on the homepage ledger — `business` picks it.
 *
 * A Server Component apart from the figure's count-up.
