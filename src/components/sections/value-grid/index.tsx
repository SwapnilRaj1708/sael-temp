 * which carry the asset's intrinsic 128px so `next/image` can reserve the box
 * and pick a sensible srcset. `image` accepts `null` for a page whose artwork
 * has not been supplied; it then holds the same box as a plain placeholder,

/**
 * A heading over a grid of value cards — a mark, a name, a paragraph.

 * Built to `About Us.dc.html` §05 "Our Strategic Pillars" (three cards, an
 * accent, the 260px floor) and §07 "Our Guiding Principles" (eight cards, no
 * accent, the 340px floor). One component, because the two differ only in
 * things that are properly props, and it is the shape FE-07 → FE-15 inherit
 * for any "here are N things we believe" surface.
 *
 * **The grid arrives as one `<Reveal>`, not one per card.** That is the
 * design's own composition and it is right here: eight cards cascading at
 * `--duration-reveal-step` apart would still be arriving long after the reader
 * got to them. The heading block above still cascades per element, which is
 * the rule that matters — see `design-reconciliation.md` §9.
 *
 * The mark is a `ReactNode` rather than an image, because the two surfaces
 * supply different kinds: §05's are line art drawn in `pillar-marks.tsx` and
 * animated, §07's are artwork files that have not been supplied. Keeping it a
 * node is what lets this component stay ignorant of the difference.
 *
 * `balance` and `ground` were added on 2026-09-22 for the Careers page, both
 * opt-in — see their prop notes. No earlier call site changes.
 *
 * A Server Component. The cards' hover and focus states are CSS.
