/**
 * The Our Team directory: heading, breadcrumb, and a tabbed grid of people.
 *
 * Built to **`Our Team.dc.html`** (Claude Design project
 * `a6a044b5-3829-44df-baae-d700f52344ec`), read through the design MCP.
 *
 * **This page has no `<PageHero>`, and that is the one place it departs from
 * `docs/features/07-our-team.md` §1.** The design opens on the `black-dots`
 * ground with the `<h1>` and a standfirst, not on a full-bleed banner — and
 * there is no Our Team banner photograph in `docs/asset-inventory.md` to put
 * behind one. The client's ruling on 2026-09-10 was to follow the design and
 * keep the breadcrumb, which the design also omits: `BreadcrumbList` is
 * required on every page below the root by
 * `docs/accessibility-and-seo.md` §3, and dropping the trail would have traded
 * a real SEO obligation for a visual detail. So the section renders the
 * design's opening with `<Breadcrumb>` restored above the title.
 *
 * That makes this the **second** inner-page opening, beside
 * `sections/page-hero/`. It is not a rival template: a page with a banner
 * photograph still uses `<PageHero>`. This is what a page without one looks
 * like, and FE-08 → FE-15 should pick by whether the client has supplied
 * artwork, not by which came first.
 *
 * **One section, not two.** The design draws the heading, the tabs and the
 * cards inside a single `SAEL.Section`, and splitting them would put a seam of
 * `--spacing-section-y` between a tab and the panel it controls.
 *
 * Content-agnostic, like every section: the title, the standfirst, the trail,
 * the tab labels and the roster all arrive as props. It knows that a team has
 * groups; it does not know that they are called Leadership and Management.
 *
 * A Server Component. Only `<TeamTabs>` and each card's `<BioDisclosure>` are
 * client leaves, and both panels are rendered here and passed down as nodes.
