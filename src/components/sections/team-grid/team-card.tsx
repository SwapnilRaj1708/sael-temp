/**
 * One person: portrait, name, designation — and, if they have a biography, the
 * dialog that opens it.
 *
 * A **Server Component**, and the sanitiser call is why that matters.
 * `sanitizeBio` runs here, so `sanitize-html` stays on the server and only the
 * clean string crosses into `<BioDisclosure>`. Moving this file's `'use
 * client'` boundary up by one component would pull a Node HTML parser into the
 * browser bundle.
 *
 * `<Image>` and not `<MediaFrame>`: `photoUrl` is a CMS URL, not a bundled
 * `StaticImageData`. Same reason and same shape as the news card
 * (`sections/news-carousel`), and the box is held by `--aspect-team-photo`
 * either way, so a missing portrait costs no layout shift.
 *
 * Where there is no biography the name is plain text and there is no `+`. A
 * card that looks identical to its neighbours but does nothing when clicked is
 * worse than one that visibly offers less.
