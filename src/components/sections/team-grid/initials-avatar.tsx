 * `docs/features/07-our-team.md`: "`photo === null` → an initials avatar on a
 * brand-gradient background. Do not ship a broken image icon." The roster the
 * client publishes today has a portrait for every one of its seventeen people,
 * so nothing on the page currently takes this branch — it exists because the
 * repository type says `photoUrl` is nullable, and a card that renders a
 * cracked-image glyph the first time the backend omits one is a card that was
 * never finished.
 *
 * Deliberately **not** `<MediaFrame>`'s pending placeholder. That grey block
 * means "this asset has not been supplied yet and will be"; this means "this
 * person has no portrait", which is a permanent state and should look
 * intentional rather than unfinished.
 *
 * `aria-hidden`, because the card's `<h3>` is the name immediately below it —
 * a screen reader announcing "JS" and then "Jasbir Singh" is repetition, and
 * the initials carry nothing the heading does not.
