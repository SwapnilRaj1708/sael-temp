 * **The only client component on this page**, and it is one leaf per card

 * it, including the portrait, the designation and the grid itself, is server
 * rendered.
 *
 * A native `<dialog>` opened with `showModal()`, which is what
 * `docs/features/07-our-team.md`'s three dialog criteria are asking for and
 * which the platform already implements correctly: focus is trapped inside the
 * top layer, `Esc` closes, and closing returns focus to the element that was
 * focused when it opened — the trigger. A hand-rolled modal would be several
 * hundred lines to get those three wrong.
 *
 * The trigger's `before:absolute before:inset-0` spreads its hit area over the
 * whole `<Card>`, which is the positioned ancestor, so the portrait and the
 * designation are clickable too. That is the design's own composition, and it
 * is done with a pseudo-element rather than by wrapping the card in a button
 * so that the accessible name stays "Jasbir Singh" and not the card's entire
 * text content.
 *
 * The `+` beside the name is `aria-hidden`: `aria-haspopup="dialog"` on the
 * button already tells a screen reader what activating it does, and a literal
 * "plus" announced after every name would be noise.
