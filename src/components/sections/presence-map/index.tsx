/**
 * "Our Current Power Portfolio" — the dotted India map and its project sites.
 * docs/features/04 §5, rebuilt to `SAEL Home v2`.
 *
 * **It carries a section label now, and the design does not.** `SAEL Home v2`
 * opens its "04 Power Portfolio" screen straight onto the display heading —
 * this was the one section on the page without the small tracked label above
 * it, and it read as the odd one out for exactly that reason. Added at the
 * client's request on 2026-08-26. `bright`, the tone the other two sections
 * on the black ground take, so the three read as a set.
 *
 * **Map left, copy right.** The previous build centred the map and hung the
 * footprint label and its two figures over the artwork at percentage offsets,
 * which was always an interim — the tracker recorded the right-hand column as
 * commented out pending a layout review. v2 settles it: two columns, the map
 * in one and heading, label and figures in the other, and nothing positioned
 * over the artwork any more.
 *
 * v2 sets those columns at 1–6 and 8–12, leaving a whole empty column between
 * them, and the two figures a `clamp(24px, 4vw, 64px)` apart. Both were pulled
 * in at the client's request — the figures on 2026-08-21, the columns again on
 * 2026-08-22.
 *
 * **A centred row, not a grid**, and that is what finally closed the gap. On a
 * twelve-column grid both halves are capped — the map by `--spacing-map`, the
 * copy by its own measure — so each floats in the middle of a column that is
 * wider than it, and the slack lands between them. Sizing the two blocks and
 * centring the row puts exactly one `--spacing-flow` between them at every
 * width. The rule above the footprint label is capped harder still, for the
 * same reason it exists: it is a break between two blocks, not a border on the
 * section.
 *
 * **The artwork is a supplied file now, not geometry.** See the note in
 * dots.ts: the client sent `dotted-map.svg` on 2026-08-21, so the 751-subpath
 * `<path>` and the gradient this component used to declare are both gone. The
 * six site coordinates are mapped across from the old space and want an eye —
 * also in that note.
 *
 * The map, its pins and their callouts are `<PresenceMapFigure>` since
 * 2026-09-18, shared with the Solar Energy page's `<ProjectsMap>`. The two
 * things that were right about the earlier build — no JavaScript, and a real
 * control per pin carrying the callout's text — live there now.
