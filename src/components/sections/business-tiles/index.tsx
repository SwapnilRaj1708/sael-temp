                    place the business is named.

                    A plain <Image>, not <MediaFrame>. The frame primitive
                    exists for a photograph filling a box its parent sized, and
                    using it for a mark meant undoing it three times over: an
                    aspect ratio computed from the import to stop the box
                    disagreeing with the artwork, `object-contain` to cancel
                    its `object-cover`, and `overflow-visible` to cancel its
                    clip. Three corrections to arrive back at what an <img>
                    does unaided. A static import already carries the artwork's
                    intrinsic width and height, so a width and `h-auto` draw
                    each mark at its own proportions — nothing to letterbox and
                    nothing to crop, which is the whole requirement.

                    The four run 0.838 to 1.002, so their rendered heights
                    differ. That is the artwork, not a defect: they are pinned
                    to a common width and centred on the row. (These files were
                    re-cut on 2026-08-26 from the hero masters after the first
                    set turned out to be sliced through at the bottom edge —
                    the crop the client reported was baked into the PNGs, not
                    applied by anything here.)
