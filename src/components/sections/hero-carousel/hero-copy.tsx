/**
 * The hero's content column: the slide's mark, a short red rule, the headline.
 *
 * **One column for all four slides, not one per slide.** The earlier design
 * placed each headline and mark at its own coordinates in the frame, so a
 * slide was a whole composition and the four cross-faded as units.
 * `SAEL Home v2` has a single composition — the column sits in the right-hand
 * half above `lg` and spans the width below it — so what changes between
 * slides is only the mark and the words. Both are stacked in a single grid
 * cell and cross-faded in place, which is also what keeps the red rule
 * between them still while they change.
 *
 * Stacking in one cell rather than swapping the mounted child is deliberate:
 * the stack is as tall as its tallest member at all times, so a longer
 * headline arriving does not move the rule, the mark, or the section's height.
 *
 * Below `lg` the column is bottom-anchored rather than centred — that is the
 * design's own mobile arrangement, and it is what leaves the photograph's
 * subject visible above the copy. docs/responsive-strategy.md §4.

            meaning — so the whole stack is hidden from assistive technology
            rather than each image carrying an empty alt.

            **Each mark is drawn at its own proportions, in no box.** A plain
            <Image> at a height with `w-auto`, not a <MediaFrame>: the frame
            primitive exists for a photograph filling a box its parent sized,
            and the four marks are not that. They are cropped to their own
            artwork and run 0.65 to 0.92 wide-to-tall, so a square frame gave
            each of them a different amount of slack, and `object-contain`
            split that slack evenly — which is what left them centred, and
            each one centred at a *different* offset, so the mark also shifted
            sideways as the carousel cross-faded. Left-aligning inside the box
            would have fixed the symptom; giving them no box to be aligned in
            means there is no slack to distribute. The client asked for them
            flush left on 2026-08-27.

            The same call, for the same reason, as the business ledger's marks
            — see the note in sections/business-tiles. A static import already
            carries the artwork's intrinsic width and height, so a height and
            `w-auto` is all it takes.

            The height is shared, which is what matters for the stack: all four
            are `h-hero-icon`, so the cross-fade never changes the column's
            height. `justify-items-start` puts every left edge on the same
            line, and they are stacked in one grid area. */}
