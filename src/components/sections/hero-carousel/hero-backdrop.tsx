/**
 * One slide's photograph and the scrims over it.
 *
 * Purely decorative: the copy that changes with the slide is not in here. In
 * the earlier design each slide carried its own headline and mark, positioned
 * per slide, so a slide was one self-contained composition. `SAEL Home v2` has
 * a single composition — the content column sits in the right-hand half at
 * every width — so the copy is one stack that cross-fades in place (see
 * `<HeroCopy>`) and what is left here is the backdrop.
 *
 * All four backdrops stay mounted and cross-fade on `opacity`, which is what
 * makes the transition free to composite. The inactive ones are `aria-hidden`
 * so a screen reader is read one photograph's description rather than four.
 * The `alt` text is still outstanding — docs/asset-inventory.md §9 — and these
 * are photographs of real sites, not decoration, so it stays a TODO rather
 * than being closed off with `alt=""`.
 *
 * Three scrims, and each earns its place:
 *
 *  - the **side** scrim darkens the right-hand half, under the copy, above lg;
 *  - the **stacked** scrim replaces it below lg, where the copy is
 *    bottom-anchored and the gradient has to run bottom-up instead;
 *  - the **foot** scrim is on at every size and is only there so the progress
 *    bar along the section's base never lands on a bright patch of sky.

          protects LCP at one breakpoint and wrecks it at the other, and
          `next/image` cannot express a media-conditioned `<picture>` source.
