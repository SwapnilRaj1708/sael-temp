 * side rather than the one sweep the design draws. Keeping the run in a single
 * box is the only way to get one gradient across it.
 *
 * The cost is that the run enters as a unit rather than word by word, and it
 * is the right trade: the sweep is the thing you can see.
 *
 * If `highlight` is absent or is not an exact run of words in the headline,
 * every word comes back unhighlighted and the headline renders flat. A typo
 * there costs a highlight, not a headline.
