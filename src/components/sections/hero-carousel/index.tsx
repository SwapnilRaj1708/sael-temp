 * The homepage hero. docs/features/04 §1, rebuilt to `SAEL Home v2`.
 *
 * The v2 arrangement, and what changed from the one before it:
 *
 *  - **One composition, not four.** The mark, a short red rule and the
 *    headline sit in a single content column — the right-hand half above `lg`,
 *    the full width and bottom-anchored below it. The six per-slide
 *    coordinates that used to place each headline in the frame are gone. See
 *    `<HeroCopy>`.
 *  - **A progress bar across the base**, pinned to the bottom edge of a
 *    section that is exactly one viewport tall — so it is on screen for as
 *    long as the hero is. It fills once across the whole cycle rather than
 *    once per slide. See `<HeroProgress>`.
 *  - **The headline is set at --text-hero**, the site's own display size,
 *    rather than the larger size the design file draws it at. The client's
 *    call on 2026-08-20: the layout is v2's, the type scale is ours.
 *
 * The one client component on this page, and the only section that needs to
 * be: it owns timers, pointer tracking and a slide index. Everything it can
 * hand to CSS, it does — the Ken Burns pan, the word stagger, the letterbox
 * reveal, the dot fill and the marquee-style pauses are all classes from
 * animations.css whose still state is the *default* and whose motion is inside
 * `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)`. So the reduced-motion
 * build of this carousel is not a second code path; it is what the CSS does
 * when nothing opts in. /CLAUDE.md §5, docs/design-guidelines.md §5.
 *
 * Autoplay is the one piece of motion CSS cannot own, and `useHeroCarousel`
 * gates it on the same preference.
