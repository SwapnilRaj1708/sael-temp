# FE-03 — App Shell: Header, Mobile Nav, Footer

**Depends on:** FE-02
**Reads:** `design-guidelines.md`, `responsive-strategy.md`, `accessibility-and-seo.md`

The shell wraps all twenty pages. **The mobile navigation does not exist in the prototype** — it is new design work and the most consequential piece of this item.

---

## 1. Navigation config

`src/components/layout/header/nav-config.ts` — one array, consumed by the desktop nav, the mobile drawer, the footer, and `sitemap.ts`. A route that is not in this array does not exist as far as the site is concerned.

```ts
export interface NavItem {
  label: string;
  href: string;                 // always with trailing slash
  children?: NavItem[];
  /** Businesses and Sustainability menus show a thumbnail per item on desktop. */
  image?: { src: string; alt: string };
}
```

Structure, matching the live site exactly:

| Label | Href | Children |
|---|---|---|
| Company | — (trigger only) | About Us `/about-us/`, Our Team `/our-team/` |
| Businesses | — | Solar Energy `/solar-energy/`, Waste To Energy `/waste-to-energy/`, Module Manufacturing `/module-manufacturing/`, Solar Cell Manufacturing `/solar-cell-manufacturing/` |
| Sustainability | — | Story of Our Influence `/story-of-our-influence/`, Our Key ESG Metrics `/our-key-esg-metrics/`, Our Core Beliefs `/our-core-beliefs/` |
| Investors | — | Offer Documents `/investors/offer-documents/`, Corporate Governance `/investors/corporate-governance/`, Financials & Reports `/investors/financials-and-reports/`, Notifications `/investors/notifications/`, Investor Contact `/investors/contact-us/` |
| Newsroom | `/newsroom/` | — |
| Career | `/career/` | — (external redirect) |
| Contact Us | `/contact-us/` | — |

> The prototype's header lists these seven as flat links with no dropdowns. The **live site has dropdowns**, and the IA requires them. Build the dropdowns. Flag to design that the prototype's flat treatment is not viable for 20 routes.

## 2. Header — `src/components/layout/header/`

### Desktop (≥ lg) — `desktop-nav.tsx`

Per `design-guidelines.md` §4:

- Fixed, 84px, `z-index: 100`, glass background with `backdrop-filter: blur(18px) saturate(160%)` and a `@supports` fallback.
- Logo left, 42px tall, links to `/`.
- Nav right, 42px gap, `--text-nav`, colour `rgba(28,32,40,.82)`, hover `--color-accent-hover`.
- **Dropdowns:** items with `children` open a panel on hover *and* on focus/click. Businesses and Sustainability use the image-card layout (thumbnail + title); Company and Investors use a plain link list.
- Dropdown behaviour: opens on hover after a ~120ms intent delay, closes on mouse-leave after ~200ms (prevents flicker when crossing the gap), closes on `Esc`, closes on route change. Keyboard: `Enter`/`Space` toggles, arrow keys move within, `Esc` returns focus to the trigger.
- Active route indication: the top-level item whose subtree contains the current path gets a persistent underline or colour change. Uses `usePathname()`, so the nav is a client component — keep it as small a client boundary as possible.

### Mobile (< lg) — `mobile-nav.tsx` `'use client'`

**New design. Specify with design before building if there is any doubt.**

- Header collapses to 64px. Logo 32px left, hamburger right in a 44×44px target.
- Tapping opens a full-height drawer sliding in from the right (280ms, `cubic-bezier(.2,.8,.2,1)`), covering the viewport with an opaque `--color-surface` background — not a translucent overlay, the content behind is visually noisy.
- Drawer contents: close button top-right (44×44), then the nav items stacked at `--text-h3`. Items with children are `<Accordion>` disclosures; tapping the label expands, it does not navigate. Leaf items navigate and close the drawer.
- Below the nav: the four social icons and a "Contact Us" primary button.
- **Accessibility, non-negotiable:** focus trapped inside the drawer; `Esc` closes; focus returns to the hamburger on close; `aria-expanded` on the trigger; `role="dialog"` + `aria-modal="true"` + `aria-label="Main navigation"` on the panel; body scroll locked via `use-lock-body-scroll` without layout shift.
- Route change closes the drawer.
- With `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`, the drawer appears without the slide.

### Scroll behaviour

The header is fixed at all times. On scroll past ~80px, increase the background opacity slightly and the shadow — subtle, 200ms. Do **not** hide-on-scroll-down; corporate sites with deep IA benefit from a persistently reachable nav.

### Layout offset

The prototype uses `margin-top: 84px` on the hero. Do not do this — it breaks for every non-hero page. Instead: a spacer element or `padding-top` on `<main>` equal to the header height token, plus `scroll-padding-top` on `html` so anchor links (the SDG deep links) do not land under the header.

## 3. Footer — `src/components/layout/footer/`

Content is fixed and lives in `src/lib/content/static/footer.ts`.

### Structure (per prototype and live site)

1. **Top row:** SAEL white logo left; four social icon buttons right (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, X) — 44px circles, white fill, `--color-footer-icon` glyph, hover lifts 3px.
2. **Link grid, 4 columns:**
   - *Know More* — About Us, Our Team, Contact Us, Newsroom, Career
   - *Solutions* — Solar Energy, Waste To Energy, Module Manufacturing, Solar Cell Manufacturing
   - *Sustainability* — Story of Our Influence, Our Key ESG Metrics, Our Core Beliefs
   - *Investors* — Corporate Governance, Financials & Reports, Notifications, Investor Contact
3. **Corporate block** — present on the live site, absent from the prototype. **Include it**, it is legally useful:
   > SAEL INDUSTRIES LIMITED
   > Registered Office: H. No. 44, Model Town, Firozpur, Guruharsahai, Punjab, India, 152022
   > CIN: U40106PB2022PLC055755
   > Telephone: 011-44910011 · Email: (from `site.ts`)

   Place it above the divider. Confirm placement with design.
4. **Divider**, then legal bar: `© {currentYear} SAEL | All Rights Reserved` left; Privacy Policy, Disclaimer, Terms & Conditions right.

Background: `footer-background.jpg` over `--color-footer-bg`.

Notes:

- The year is computed at render, not hardcoded.
- The email on the live site is Cloudflare-obfuscated. Use a plain `mailto:` — obfuscation is theatre and it breaks accessibility.
- Below `md` the link groups become accordions and the top row stacks and centres. See `responsive-strategy.md`.
- `<nav aria-label="Footer">` around the link grid.

---

## 4. Root layout

`src/app/layout.tsx`:

- `<html lang="en">` with the DIN font variable class.
- Skip link to `#main-content` as the first focusable element.
- `<Header />`, `<main id="main-content">{children}</main>`, `<Footer />`.
- `metadataBase` from `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`; title template `%s | SAEL`.
- `Organization` and `WebSite` JSON-LD.
- Staging guard: emit `robots: { index: false, follow: false }` when `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` is not the production host.

Also build `not-found.tsx` and `error.tsx` properly — branded, with the shell, and a route back to the homepage. These get seen during a migration more than anyone expects.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Header matches the prototype at 1920px
- [ ] Dropdowns work on hover, click, and keyboard; close on `Esc` and on route change
- [ ] Mobile drawer: opens, traps focus, `Esc` closes, focus returns to the trigger, body scroll locked, closes on navigation
- [ ] The entire nav — desktop and mobile, including dropdowns — is operable with keyboard only
- [ ] Adding a route to `nav-config.ts` makes it appear in the desktop nav, the mobile drawer, and the sitemap with no other change
- [ ] Footer accordions work below `md`; four columns above
- [ ] No content is obscured by the fixed header, including when navigating to an `#anchor`
- [ ] At 360px there is no horizontal overflow: `document.body.scrollWidth === window.innerWidth`
- [ ] Reduced motion: no drawer slide, no header transition
- [ ] `axe` scan on a page with the drawer open: zero criticals
- [ ] `pnpm check` passes

## Blocked on

- SAEL logo as **SVG**, colour and white variants (`asset-inventory.md` §9)
- Design sign-off on the mobile drawer, which has no prototype reference

## On completion

Move to Done, promote **FE-04**.
