# Architecture

## 1. Stack

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | **Next.js 16+, App Router** | Server Components keep the marketing pages near-zero JS; file-based routing maps cleanly onto the fixed IA |
| Language | **TypeScript, `strict: true`** | The backend contracts are not finalised — types are how we survive the change |
| Runtime | **Node 25** | Pinned in `.nvmrc`; `engines` accepts `>=24` so the archive also runs on a current-LTS VM |
| Styling | **Tailwind CSS v4** (CSS-first `@theme`) | Tokens live in CSS, are readable by designers, and are enforceable via lint |
| Fonts | `next/font/local` (DIN, client-supplied) | Self-hosted, zero layout shift, no third-party CDN |
| Variants | `class-variance-authority` + `clsx` + `tailwind-merge` | Typed component variants without string soup |
| Animation | CSS first; `motion` (Framer Motion) only where CSS cannot express it | Bundle discipline — most of the prototype's motion is pure CSS |
| Validation | **Zod** | Runtime validation at the API boundary; also drives form schemas |
| Forms | `react-hook-form` + `@hookform/resolvers/zod` | Accessible, uncontrolled, small |
| Icons | Local SVG components + `lucide-react` for utility icons | Brand icons are client-supplied SVGs, not an icon-font |
| Package manager | **pnpm** | Deterministic, fast, disk-efficient in CI |

**Not in scope** (confirmed with client): internationalisation, analytics/GTM, cookie consent, gated investor login, Storybook, automated test suites. Do not add them speculatively. The architecture below does not preclude any of them.

## 3. Layering rules

Dependencies flow **one way only**. A violation of this is the main way a codebase like this rots.

```
app/ (routes)
  ↓ fetches data, composes
components/sections/
  ↓ composes
components/ui/
  ↓
lib/utils, styles
```

- `app/*/page.tsx` — owns data fetching, metadata, and section composition. Contains almost no markup of its own beyond `<main>` and section ordering.
- `components/sections/*` — receives typed props, renders. **Never** imports from `lib/content`. **Never** knows whether its data came from a mock or an API.
- `components/ui/*` — knows nothing about SAEL. A `<Button>` does not know what "Know More" is.
- `lib/*` — no React imports except where explicitly a hook.

**The test:** if you can copy `components/sections/news-grid/` into an unrelated project and it compiles given its props type, it is correct.

---

## 4. Section composition pattern

Every page is a list of sections. Sections take a props object and nothing else:

```tsx
// src/app/page.tsx  (Server Component)
import { getContentRepository } from '@/lib/content';
import { HeroCarousel } from '@/components/sections/hero-carousel';
import { NewsGrid } from '@/components/sections/news-grid';

export default async function HomePage() {
  const repo = getContentRepository();
  const [news, stats] = await Promise.all([
    repo.getLatestNews({ limit: 3 }),
    repo.getCapacityStats(),
  ]);

  return (
    <main>
      <HeroCarousel slides={HOMEPAGE_HERO_SLIDES} intervalMs={6000} />
      <StatsBand stats={stats} />
      {/* … */}
      <NewsGrid eyebrow="In the News" items={news} viewAllHref="/newsroom/" />
    </main>
  );
}
```

Static, design-owned content (hero slide copy, mission/vision/ethos text) lives in a colocated `content.ts` beside the page or in `src/lib/content/static/`. Backend-owned content comes from the repository. **Do not** route static marketing copy through the repository — it adds a network hop for text that changes once a year.

### Why not a JSON-driven section registry?

It was considered and rejected for v1. With ~20 fixed pages and no CMS, a registry adds indirection without buying anything: the client cannot reorder sections without a developer either way. Sections are already independently reusable via props, which is the part that actually matters. If a CMS is introduced later, a registry can be layered on top without changing the section components — that is precisely why they are content-agnostic.

---

## 5. Rendering strategy

Deployment target is unknown and may be multi-instance. That rules out ISR (which needs a shared cache handler we cannot configure yet). The strategy below works identically on a single VM and on Azure Container Apps with N replicas.

| Page class | Strategy | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Fully static (About, 4 Business, 3 Sustainability, SDG, 3 Legal) | **SSG** at build | Default. No `fetch`, no dynamic APIs. |
| Homepage | **SSG shell + cached server fetch** | The only dynamic part is the 3 latest news items. `fetch(..., { next: { revalidate: 300 } })` |
| Newsroom, Investor documents, Notifications, Our Team, ESG metrics | **Dynamic SSR with a 5-minute data cache** | `fetch(..., { next: { revalidate: 300, tags: ['news'] } })` |
| Forms | **Route handlers**, `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` | `src/app/api/forms/[form]/route.ts` |
| Career | **Route handler redirect** | `permanentRedirect()` — no page |

Notes:

- Per-instance caching is acceptable here. Worst case a replica serves a press release five minutes late. That is a correct trade for deployment portability.
- Cache tags are declared now (`tags: ['news']`) so that on-demand revalidation can be switched on later without touching call sites, once the hosting model is known.
- **While `CONTENT_SOURCE=mock`**, the repository resolves from local fixtures with no network call, so every page above still prerenders as static. This is intentional — the mock phase should build fast and deploy anywhere.

---

## 6. Configuration and environment

`src/lib/config/env.ts` validates `process.env` with Zod at module load. A missing required variable fails the **build**, not the first request.

```
# .env.example
CONTENT_SOURCE=mock                  # mock | api
API_BASE_URL=                        # Spring Boot gateway, required when CONTENT_SOURCE=api
API_TIMEOUT_MS=8000
AZURE_BLOB_BASE_URL=                 # e.g. https://<account>.blob.core.windows.net/public
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://www.sael.co
CAREER_REDIRECT_URL=                 # Oracle recruiting system — client to confirm
```

Rules:

- Only variables that must reach the browser get the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix. `API_BASE_URL` must **not**.
- Nothing reads `process.env` directly outside `env.ts`.
- Azure Blob URLs are composed with `blobUrl(path)` from `lib/utils/blob-url.ts`, never string-concatenated at the call site.

`next.config.ts` essentials:

```ts
const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  output: 'standalone',
  trailingSlash: true,              // URL parity with the legacy site — see accessibility-and-seo.md
  images: {
    remotePatterns: [
      { protocol: 'https', hostname: '*.blob.core.windows.net' },
      { protocol: 'https', hostname: 'www.sael.co' },   // during migration only
    ],
    formats: ['image/avif', 'image/webp'],
  },
  poweredByHeader: false,
  async redirects() { /* see features/22-seo-and-redirects.md */ },
};
```

---

## 7. Backend integration boundary

The Spring Boot services do not exist yet. Everything below is designed so the cutover (FE-23) is a config change plus one adapter, not a refactor.

```
Browser ──▶ Next.js server ──▶ Spring Boot gateway ──▶ MySQL
                   │
                   └──▶ Azure Blob (PDF/image URLs only, no proxying)
```

- **Reads** happen in Server Components via `getContentRepository()`. The browser never sees `API_BASE_URL`.
- **Writes** (forms) go browser → Next route handler → Spring Boot. The route handler is a thin, validating proxy: parse with Zod, forward, normalise the response to `{ ok: true } | { ok: false, message, fieldErrors? }`.
- **PDFs and large media** are linked directly to their Azure Blob URL. Next.js does not proxy or re-host them.
- **Failure is a first-class state.** A backend timeout renders an `<EmptyState>` with a human message, never a 500. The rest of the page must still render.

See `content-model.md` for the repository contract and `api-contracts.md` for the endpoint shapes to hand to the backend team.

---

## 8. Deployment

**Azure VM, Nginx + PM2.** No container step. We build an archive and hand it over; the client's team extracts and runs it.

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm build          # output: 'standalone'
pnpm package        # -> release/sael-web-<version>.tar.gz
```

The archive contains the standalone server, its dependencies, `.next/static`, `public/`, `ecosystem.config.cjs` and a `DEPLOY.txt`. It runs with `pm2 start ecosystem.config.cjs` — **no install step on the VM**.

### Why `nodeLinker: hoisted`

`output: 'standalone'` copies `node_modules` verbatim. Under pnpm's default symlinked layout, those links point back into the build machine's store — on Windows as absolute paths — so the archive only runs on the machine that built it. Dereferencing the links instead breaks pnpm's nested resolution (`next` loses its own `@swc/helpers`).

`nodeLinker: hoisted` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` gives a flat `node_modules`, which makes `.next/standalone` genuinely relocatable and lets the archive be built on any OS. The cost is pnpm's protection against phantom dependencies — a package can now import something it does not declare. If that bites, the alternative is to build releases only on Linux and drop the setting.

`scripts/package-release.mjs` refuses to produce an archive containing any unresolved link, so a regression here fails loudly rather than shipping a broken tarball.

### Required of the VM

- Node 25 (Node 24 LTS or newer also runs the archive)
- `sharp` for image optimisation — bundled into the archive, no install needed
- A writable directory for `.next/cache/images`, or accept unoptimised remote images
- Gzip/Brotli at the proxy layer (Next does not compress in standalone mode)
- Long-cache headers on `/_next/static/*` (immutable, 1 year)

The last two, plus TLS and the health probe, are in `deploy/nginx.conf.sample`.

Health check: `GET /api/health/` returning `{ status: 'ok', version }` — added in FE-01.

`NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values are compiled into the client bundle at build time. Changing one requires a rebuild, not a restart — which is why `ecosystem.config.cjs` and the build environment must agree.

## 9. Open decisions

Recorded so work is never blocked. Each has a working default already implemented.

| # | Decision | Default in force | Owner | Impact if changed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | ~~Hosting model (VM vs managed)~~ **Resolved** | Azure VM, Nginx + PM2, deployed from an archive. No container. | Client | — |
| 1a | Whether `/investors/` itself is a page | Not built — §2 lists only its children, and inventing a route would break URL parity | Client | Low — one page, no data contract |
| 2 | DIN webfont licence | Assumed held; fonts self-hosted from client-supplied files | Client legal | High — would force a substitute typeface |
| 3 | Oracle careers URL | `CAREER_REDIRECT_URL` env var, redirect stub | Client | Trivial |
| 4 | Whether `www` or apex is canonical | `www.sael.co` (matches current site) | Client | Medium — redirect map depends on it |
| 5 | Newsroom pagination size and whether detail pages exist | 9 per page; news links out to external publishers as today, no detail route | Client | Medium — a detail route adds a dynamic segment and slug contract |
| 6 | India presence map — rebuild as interactive SVG or keep as image | Responsive image + accessible state list fallback | Client / design | Medium |
| 7 | Contact form spam protection | None (backend's responsibility per client) | Backend team | Low |
| 8 | Image CDN in front of Azure Blob | Direct Blob URLs | Client | Low — swap `blobUrl()` base |
