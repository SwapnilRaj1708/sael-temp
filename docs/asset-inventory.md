# Asset Inventory

The prototype ships ~200MB of assets across two folders with inconsistent naming. This document is the authoritative map from prototype asset to repository asset. **Never reference a prototype filename in code.**

---

## 1. Why this document exists

The prototype references assets from two places:

- **`assets/`** — curated, sensibly named. Mostly usable.
- **`uploads/`** — raw user uploads with generated names. `uploads/pasted-1784663527717-0.png` **is the SAEL logo.** The prototype's own `CLAUDE.md` warns that this folder resyncs and edits do not persist.

Additionally, several assets are enormous unoptimised originals. Shipping them as-is would blow the performance budget on the first page load. Every asset below has a required target size.

---

## 2. Critical findings

| Asset | Size in prototype | Problem |
|---|---|---|
| `news-solar.jpg` | **12.5 MB** | 3 of these load on the homepage. ~34MB of news thumbnails. |
| `news-agri.jpg` | **11.4 MB** | Same. |
| `news-mfg.jpg` | **8.7 MB** | Same. |
| `hero-man.jpg` | **10.7 MB** | Unused in the final homepage — leftover from an earlier hero direction. |
| `hero-boy.jpg` | **9.7 MB** | Unused. |
| `hero-woman.jpg` | **9.4 MB** | Unused. |
| `vision-bg.png` | **8.4 MB** | Photographic content stored as PNG. Must be JPEG/WebP. |
| `solar-plant.png` | **1.7 MB** | Photographic content stored as PNG. Must be JPEG/WebP. |

**Action required from the client before FE-04:** supply the original high-resolution masters for the three news images and confirm which hero photography is final. Do not re-compress an already-compressed 12MB JPEG — request the master.

---

## 3. Naming and placement rules

```
src/assets/
├── fonts/          DIN — client supplied, licensed. WOFF2 only in the repo.
├── images/
│   ├── hero/
│   ├── sections/
│   ├── news/       placeholder only — production news images come from Azure Blob
│   └── decorative/
└── icons/          SVGs imported as React components
public/
└── images/         only assets referenced by URL string (OG image, favicon set)
```

Rules:

- **kebab-case, descriptive, no dates, no dimensions in the name.** `hero-solar-modules.jpg`, not `hero-modules-1920.jpg` or `pasted-1784663527717-0.png`.
- Assets imported by `next/image` live in `src/assets/`, are content-hashed at build, and get automatic width/height. **Prefer this.**
- `public/` is only for assets referenced by a literal URL string that Next cannot process: favicons, `og-image.png`, `robots.txt`.
- Icons that need to inherit `currentColor` become inline React components (via SVGR). Icons that are fixed-colour brand artwork stay as files.
- Photographic content is **never PNG**. PNG is for transparency and flat graphics only.
- Every raster asset is committed at a single sensible master size; `next/image` derives the rest. Do not commit `@2x` variants.

## 4. Mapping table

### Logo and identity

| Prototype path | Repository path | Format | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `uploads/pasted-1784663527717-0.png` | `src/assets/images/sael-logo.png` | PNG | **Interim, by decision on 2026-08-04.** See below. |
| *(footer variant)* | `src/assets/images/sael-logo-dark.svg` | SVG | **Supplied 2026-08-27**, and the first vector of the wordmark we have. Drawn for a dark ground: white strapline, the SAEL wordmark on its own red→purple gradient. Consumed by the footer at `--spacing-footer-logo`. **38% of its height is empty** — the ink is 1293 × 329 inside a 1521.67 × 530.77 viewBox — so size the box from the ink, and re-measure if it is re-exported |
| — | `public/images/og-image.png` | PNG | 1200×630. Live site has `sael-thumbnail.png`. |
| — | `public/favicon.ico` + `icon.png` + `apple-icon.png` | — | Generate from the logo mark |

> **The colour logo ships as a raster for now.** The client's handover contains
> `sael-logo.png` but no SVG. The wordmark *is* live vector inside
> `SAEL - New Website.pdf` and could be extracted, and the live site already
> serves `sael-logo.svg`; the call on 2026-08-04 was to use the PNG and swap
> later. The committed file is the supplied 7787×1975 master, alpha-trimmed and
> resampled to **1600×398** (78 KB) — roughly 3× the largest rendered size
> (42px tall at 3× DPR), so it stays crisp without shipping an 8000px asset
> through `next/image` on every build.
>
> The white variant cannot be derived: the wordmark is a purple→red gradient
> over a black strapline, so a white version is a design decision, not a
> recolour. The footer still needs it.

### Hero carousel — **used**

| Prototype | Repository | Target | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `assets/hero-modules.jpg` | `hero/solar-modules.jpg` | ≤ 220KB @ 2400w | Slide 1 — `priority` |
| `assets/hero-generation.jpg` | `hero/energy-generation.jpg` | ≤ 220KB @ 2400w | Slide 2 |
| `assets/hero-vision.jpg` | `hero/clean-energy-vision.jpg` | ≤ 220KB @ 2400w | Slide 3 |
| `assets/hero-agri.jpg` | `hero/agri-waste.jpg` | ≤ 220KB @ 2400w | Slide 4 |

**Each hero slide needs a portrait crop for mobile** (`hero/solar-modules-portrait.jpg` etc., 4:5, ≤ 140KB @ 1080w). Delivered via `<picture>` / `next/image` with a media-conditioned source. Scaling a 2.34:1 landscape into a 4:5 frame crops out the subject — this must be an art-directed crop, not a CSS `object-position` guess. **Client/design to supply the crops.**

### Hero overlay icons — **used**

| Prototype | Repository | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `assets/icon-1-symbol.svg` | `icons/symbol-solar-generation.svg` | Large watermark symbol, slide 3 |
| `assets/icon-2-symbol.svg` | `icons/symbol-cell-manufacturing.svg` | Slide 1 |
| `assets/icon-3-symbol.svg` | `icons/symbol-module-manufacturing.svg` | Slide 2 |
| `assets/icon-4-symbol.svg` | `icons/symbol-agri-waste.svg` | Slide 4 |

### Business tile icons — **used**

The client supplied these on 2026-08-04 as `Business Icons/Icons-Sael-0N.svg`.
Byte sizes match the prototype's `icon-N.svg` exactly, and the gradient stops
confirm the mapping, so the numbering is the same in both sets.

| Prototype | Client file | Repository | Identifying gradient |
|---|---|---|---|
| `assets/icon-1.svg` | `Icons-Sael-01.svg` | `icons/business-solar-generation.svg` | yellow → red → purple |
| `assets/icon-2.svg` | `Icons-Sael-02.svg` | `icons/business-cell-manufacturing.svg` | indigo → purple → magenta |
| `assets/icon-3.svg` | `Icons-Sael-03.svg` | `icons/business-module-manufacturing.svg` | blue → teal → green |
| `assets/icon-4.svg` | `Icons-Sael-04.svg` | `icons/business-agri-waste.svg` | near-black → green |

Full-colour brand artwork with gradients and `clipPath`s. **Keep as files for
`next/image`; do not run them through SVGR** — each declares its own `.cls-1`
and gradient `id`, so inlining four of them on one page would collide.

> **Open: the labels are baked into the artwork.** Every one of these carries
> its wordmark as outlined letter paths below the icon — `Icons-Sael-03.svg` is
> the mark plus "N-TYPE MODULE MANUFACTURING" in vector outlines (21 of its 22
> shapes are lettering). The supplied PNGs are the same with white text. The
> business tile renders that heading as real HTML as well, so as-is the label
> would be duplicated, and the vector copy is unselectable, untranslatable and
> invisible to screen readers.
>
> Deferred on 2026-08-04 — **resolve before the FE-04 tiles are built.** Either
> the client supplies marks without lettering (they are separate objects
> upstream), or we strip the letter paths and re-crop the viewBox, with design
> confirming the crop.

The PNG variants (`SOLAR Icon.png` and siblings, 1880×2493) have **white**
lettering baked in and are intended for dark backgrounds. Not used on the site.

### Tile shapes — **rebuild, do not import**

| Prototype | Action |
|---|---|
| `assets/rtile-2.svg` … `rtile-5.svg` | **Reimplement in CSS.** |
| `assets/tile-2.svg` … `tile-5.svg` | Unused variants — discard. |

Reason: these are a single path with `preserveAspectRatio="none"` and a hardcoded `fill="#e8e9eb"`. Stretching them to a tall mobile aspect ratio distorts the 18px corner radii into ellipses, and the fill cannot be tokenised. The shape is a rounded rectangle with a chamfered bottom-right corner — express it as:

```css
clip-path: polygon(0 0, 100% 0, 100% calc(100% - 44px), calc(100% - 44px) 100%, 0 100%);
border-radius: var(--radius-card);
background: var(--color-tile-surface); /* #E8E9EB */
```

Note `clip-path` and `border-radius` do not compose on all engines — if the corner rounding is lost, use an inline SVG generated with a viewBox matching the rendered aspect ratio instead of a stretched static file. Confirm the final approach in design review during FE-04.

### Date badge — **rebuild, do not import**

`assets/date-badge.svg` has the same problem: `preserveAspectRatio="none"` with a 16px angled notch that distorts under a variable-width date string. Rebuild in CSS using `--gradient-eyebrow` and a `clip-path` notch. See `design-guidelines.md` §4.

### Section imagery — **used**

| Prototype | Repository | Format change | Target |
|---|---|---|---|
| `uploads/Rectangle 7.png` | `sections/about-workplace.jpg` | PNG → JPEG | ≤ 180KB @ 2000w |
| `uploads/pasted-1784666085151-0.png` | `sections/about-overlay.png` | keep PNG | Transparency required. ≤ 120KB |
| `assets/india-map.png` | `sections/india-presence-map.png` | keep PNG (flat graphic) | 860×721 source. ≤ 90KB. **See §6.** |
| `assets/solar-plant.png` | `sections/mizoram-solar-plant.jpg` | **PNG → JPEG** | 1.7MB → ≤ 200KB @ 2400w |
| `assets/engineer.png` | `sections/field-engineer.png` | keep PNG | Cut-out, transparency required. 968×970. 715KB → ≤ 180KB |
| `assets/vision-bg.png` | `sections/vision-background.jpg` | **PNG → JPEG** | 8.4MB → ≤ 250KB @ 2400w |
| `assets/pixel-strip.png` | `decorative/pixel-strip.png` | keep PNG | 2613×380. 569KB → ≤ 60KB. Decorative, `alt=""` |
| `assets/footer-bg.png` | `sections/footer-background.jpg` | PNG → JPEG | ≤ 100KB |

### News images — **placeholders only**

| Prototype | Repository | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `assets/news-agri.jpg` | `news/placeholder-agri.jpg` | Mock fixture only |
| `assets/news-solar.jpg` | `news/placeholder-solar.jpg` | Mock fixture only |
| `assets/news-mfg.jpg` | `news/placeholder-manufacturing.jpg` | Mock fixture only |

Production news images come from **Azure Blob** via `NewsItem.image.url`. These three exist so the mock renders realistically; each must be re-encoded to ≤ 120KB at 1200w. Also commit a `news/fallback.jpg` for items where `image` is `null`.

### Unused — **do not migrate**

`assets/hero-man.jpg`, `assets/hero-boy.jpg`, `assets/hero-woman.jpg`, `assets/tile-2..5.svg`, `assets/reference/*`, and the entire `uploads/` folder beyond the three files mapped above. The prototype's `checkpoints/`, `Assets.dc.html`, `Hero FX Lab.dc.html`, `Timeline Experiment.dc.html` and `KnowMoreButton.dc.html` are Designer working files with no repository equivalent.

## 5. Fonts

| Client file | Repository | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `DIN.ttf` | `src/assets/fonts/din-regular.woff2` | Weight 400 |
| `DIN Bold.otf` (preferred) / `DIN Bold.ttf` | `src/assets/fonts/din-bold.woff2` | Weight 700 |

- Convert to **WOFF2** and subset to `latin` (+ `₹`, `–`, `’`, `·`, `#`, `²`). Expect ~70% size reduction.
- Load via `next/font/local` with `display: 'swap'` and `fallback: ['system-ui', 'sans-serif']`.
- Commit **WOFF2 only**. Do not commit the TTF/OTF originals — they are the licensed desktop files.
- **Licensing is unresolved** (`architecture.md` Open Decision #2). DIN is commercial; a webfont licence is a different tier from a desktop licence. Confirm before launch.

---

## 6. India presence map

`india-map.png` is a flat 860×721 raster with baked-in state labels. At mobile widths those labels render below 6px and are illegible. Regardless of which option is chosen, **a text list of the states of operation is required** as the accessible representation.

| Option | Effort | Result |
|---|---|---|
| **A — image + list** (default) | Low | Ships now. Map is decorative below `lg`, list carries the information. |
| **B — inline SVG** | Medium | Client supplies vector. States become paths; tooltips and highlighting become possible; scales cleanly. |
| **C — interactive map** | High | Per-state hover cards with capacity figures. Needs data the backend does not yet expose. |

Option A is implemented in FE-04. B/C are `architecture.md` Open Decision #6.

---

## 7. Optimisation pipeline

Run once, at migration time — not in CI. Committed assets are already optimised.

```bash
# Photographic PNG → JPEG
sharp -i vision-bg.png -o vision-background.jpg --format jpeg --quality 82 resize 2400

# JPEG re-encode
sharp -i hero-modules.jpg -o solar-modules.jpg --format jpeg --quality 80 resize 2400

# PNG with transparency
pngquant --quality=65-85 --strip engineer.png -o field-engineer.png

# SVG
svgo -f src/assets/icons --multipass
```

`next.config.ts` sets `formats: ['image/avif', 'image/webp']`, so AVIF/WebP derivatives are generated at request time. Commit the JPEG/PNG masters only.

**Budget check before any PR that adds an asset:** no committed raster exceeds **250KB**. If it must, note why in the PR description.

---

## 8. Azure Blob conventions

Backend-supplied assets (news images, investor PDFs, team photos) live in Blob Storage and arrive as absolute URLs.

- Compose with `blobUrl(path)` from `@/lib/utils/blob-url` — never string-concatenate at a call site.
- Add the account host to `next.config.ts` `images.remotePatterns`.
- **PDFs are linked, not proxied.** `<a href={doc.file.url} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">` with the file type and size in the accessible label: *"Annual Return FY 2024-25, PDF, 2.4 MB, opens in a new tab"*.
- Never commit a PDF to the repository.

---

## 9. Handover checklist

Items the client must supply before the relevant tracker item can complete:

- [x] ~~DIN font files~~ — supplied. WOFF2 in `src/assets/fonts/`, bold cut from
      the OTF. See that folder's README.
- [x] ~~Business tile icon SVGs~~ — supplied, mapped above. Lettering still to
      resolve.
- [ ] SAEL logo as **SVG**, colour variant — deferred, PNG in use meanwhile in the
      masthead. `sael-logo-dark.svg` is a vector of the same wordmark and may be
      the answer here too; it has not been checked against a light ground
- [x] ~~SAEL logo, **white** variant~~ — supplied 2026-08-27 as
      `sael-logo-dark.svg`, which unblocked the footer
- [ ] Business tile icons **without baked-in lettering** — *blocks FE-04 tiles*
- [ ] DIN webfont licence confirmation — *blocks launch*
- [ ] A cut of DIN containing `₹` (U+20B9) — absent from every supplied file
- [ ] High-resolution masters for the three news images — *blocks FE-04*
- [ ] Art-directed **portrait crops** of the four hero photographs — *blocks FE-04*
- [ ] Confirmation that hero photography is final (three unused hero images in the prototype) — *blocks FE-04*
- [ ] India map as vector, if Option B or C is chosen — *blocks Open Decision #6*
- [ ] Favicon / app icon source
- [ ] OG share image, 1200×630

---

## 10. The client handover dump

On 2026-08-04 the client delivered a raw asset dump. It lives at `/assets/`,
which is **untracked and gitignored** — it holds licensed font originals, and
it has already been replaced once. **Nothing is referenced from there at
runtime.** Anything the site needs is processed into `src/assets/` and
committed. Treat `/assets/` as read-only source material that may vanish.

There is no naming convention in it, folders are nested and duplicated, and
several files appear two or three times under different names.

### What is worth knowing about

| Path (under `assets/Web Assets & Refrences/`) | What it is |
|---|---|
| `SAEL - New Website.pdf` | **The client's own homepage design.** A single-page Illustrator export, and the most useful reference in the dump. |
| `drive-download-…/Business Icons/` | The four business icon SVGs and their white-text PNG variants. Mapped in §4. |
| `drive-download-…/Fonts/` | DIN regular/bold. Already processed — see `src/assets/fonts/README.md`. |
| `drive-download-…/Images/` | 15 photographic masters: solar farms, module and cell manufacturing, the waste-to-energy plant, biomass conveyor, farmers and engineers. |
| `drive-download-…/Website Reference Images/` | The four hero portraits from the design, as high-resolution masters. |
| `shapes/1..14.svg` | 14 chamfered gradient shapes used in the design as image masks and decoration. |
| `Shape reference/linkedin1..4.png` | Screenshots showing those shapes in use on the client's LinkedIn creatives. |
| `SAEL - New Website_Folder/` | Photography plus screenshots of the design. Its `Fonts/` also holds Gotham and Myriad Pro — **ignore both; the project is DIN only.** |
| `…/Social Media Architecture final.ai` | Saved without PDF content, so unreadable outside Illustrator. Its `.txt` sibling is only a package report. |

### How the client's design differs from the prototype

> **Reversed 2026-08-04, later the same day: the PDF is the design, and the
> prototype is reference only.** The client's instruction was explicit — the
> PDF "is the actual thing we have to make", and the Designer prototype "was
> also created by AI, so it's just a reference".
>
> So where the two disagree on **layout or composition**, the PDF wins and the
> feature docs in `docs/features/` are the stale ones. Where the PDF simply has
> no content — it sets Lorem ipsum in the business tile descriptions — the
> prototype supplies it. Neither source may be used to invent a figure.
>
> The earlier decision recorded here said the opposite. It is kept, struck
> through, because the homepage sections built before the reversal were built
> to it, and a reader who finds a prototype-shaped component needs to know why.

The points where the two disagree, and what was built:

1. The four business tiles carry the capacity figures (8299 MWp, 5 GW,
   3625 MW + 5 GW, 144.9 MW). Our docs specify a separate 4-column stats band.
   **Built to the PDF:** `sections/business-tiles/` is both, and
   `features/04` §2's stats band does not exist as a section.
2. The India map is a **dotted pixel-art map** captioned "11 STATES /
   60 PROJECT SITES", not the flat `india-map.png`. **Built to the PDF**, which
   settles Open Decision #6 in favour of a vector map — the geometry arrived
   with the handover as `Mock 3 Approved/mapDots.js` and is transcribed into
   `sections/presence-map/dots.ts`.
3. Solutions is a **carousel of four plants** — Patiala, Mizoram, Kishangarh,
   Bhadra — each a landscape photograph with a gradient plaque naming it.
   `features/04` §6 specifies a single full-bleed `<FeatureBanner>` of the
   Mizoram plant, reusable as a page hero elsewhere. **Built to the PDF** as
   `sections/solutions-carousel/`. The plaque survives the change; the reusable
   one-image banner does not exist yet, and when a business page needs one it
   is a separate primitive rather than a branch in the carousel.
4. Neither the vision timeline nor the "Our Strength" section appears.
   **Not yet decided** — both are specified in `features/04` §7 and §8 and
   neither has been built. Ask before building either.
5. The footer is an undesigned grey block — which is why no social icon
   artwork exists anywhere in the handover.

The pixel-strip divider is live vector in that PDF, and is a better source
than the prototype's 569 KB PNG.

### The 14 shapes use a gradient we do not have a token for

`#2b1b54 → #8a1e42 → #e01f2b`, which is not `--gradient-cta`
(`#F9E800 → #E40F14 → #45258D`) or any other token in `theme.css`. If these
shapes are adopted, that gradient needs to become a token first — do not
inline the stops.
