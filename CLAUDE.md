# CLAUDE.md — SAEL Corporate Website (Next.js)

This file is read automatically at the start of every Claude Code session. Read it fully before doing anything else.

## 1. What this project is

A ground-up rebuild of **https://www.sael.co** (SAEL Industries Limited — renewable energy: solar IPP, agri waste-to-energy, module and cell manufacturing) as a **Next.js 16 App Router** application.

The visual direction is fixed by an approved Claude Designer prototype of the homepage. We are **not** inventing a new design — we are re-deriving that prototype into a scalable, responsive, component-driven codebase.

**The prototype is a reference, not a source to copy.** It is a single 1,300-line HTML file with inline styles, hardcoded content, and viewport-width (`vw`) sizing tuned for a 1920px display. Porting it verbatim would fail every requirement below.

---

## 2. Non-negotiables

These are hard rules. If a task appears to require breaking one, stop and ask.

1. **Mobile-first.** Every component is authored at the smallest breakpoint first and enhanced upward with `min-width` media queries. The design is *reviewed* at 1920px but must be *correct* from 360px. See `docs/responsive-strategy.md`.
2. **No raw values in components.** No hex colours, no `vw` units, no magic pixel numbers. Everything comes from design tokens defined in `src/styles/theme.css`. See `docs/design-guidelines.md`.
3. **No invented content.** Copy, statistics, names, dates and figures come from the relevant feature doc in `docs/features/`. If a value is missing, insert `{{TODO: content}}` and list it at the end of your response — never fabricate a plausible-looking number for a company that publishes financial results.
4. **Portable build.** The client deploys to an Azure VM running Nginx + PM2, from an archive we hand over. Nothing may assume a platform-specific runtime. See §7.
5. **Every dynamic surface goes through the content repository.** No component ever calls `fetch` against the backend directly. See §6.
6. **URL parity with the legacy site.** Routes, trailing slashes and the canonical host must match the old site exactly. SEO equity depends on it. See `docs/accessibility-and-seo.md`.
7. **One In Progress item at a time.** See §3.

## 3. Session ritual — the progress tracker

`docs/frontend-progress.md` is the single source of truth for what to build next. Multiple people run Claude Code sessions against this repo; the tracker is how those sessions stay coordinated.

**At the start of every session:**

1. Read `docs/frontend-progress.md`.
2. Find the item in **In Progress**. That is your task. There is never more than one.
3. Open the feature doc that item points to (e.g. `docs/features/04-homepage.md`) and read it in full.
4. Read only the supporting docs that item's *Reads* column lists. Do not load the whole `docs/` folder into context.

**If In Progress is empty:** promote the top item from **Pending** into **In Progress**, set `Started` to today's date, and begin.

**When the item is complete** (acceptance criteria in the feature doc all met, `pnpm build` clean, `pnpm lint` clean):

1. Move the row from **In Progress** to the top of **Done**, fill in `Completed` with today's date.
2. Promote the top **Pending** row into **In Progress**.
3. Commit the tracker change **in the same commit** as the code. A tracker that disagrees with the code is worse than no tracker.

**Never** work an item that is not In Progress. If you believe the order is wrong, say so and stop — do not reorder unilaterally.

## 4. Documentation map

Load these on demand, not all at once.

| File | Read it when |
|---|---|
| `docs/architecture.md` | Creating files, deciding where code lives, adding a route |
| `docs/design-guidelines.md` | Any styling work — tokens, type, colour, motion |
| `docs/responsive-strategy.md` | Any layout work; mandatory for every section component |
| `docs/content-model.md` | Anything involving data, types, or the repository layer |
| `docs/api-contracts.md` | Wiring a form or a backend-fed list |
| `docs/asset-inventory.md` | Adding, renaming or referencing an image, icon or font |
| `docs/accessibility-and-seo.md` | Adding a route, metadata, redirect, or interactive control |
| `docs/features/NN-*.md` | Always — this is the spec for the current tracker item |

## 5. Code conventions

**Language and tooling**

- TypeScript, `strict: true`. No `any`. No `@ts-ignore` without a comment explaining why.
- pnpm. Do not commit `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`.
- Tailwind CSS v4, CSS-first config via `@theme` in `src/styles/theme.css`.
- Path alias `@/*` → `src/*`. No relative imports that climb more than one level (`../../` is a smell).

**Components**

- **Server Components by default.** Add `'use client'` only at the leaf that actually needs interactivity or browser APIs, never on a whole page or section wrapper. A carousel's arrows are client; the section around them is not.
- One component per file. File name matches the export. `PascalCase.tsx` for components, `kebab-case.ts` for everything else.
- Props interfaces are named `<ComponentName>Props` and exported.
- Section components are **content-agnostic**: they receive typed props and render. They never import fixtures or call the repository. Pages do the fetching and pass data down.
- Before writing a new UI primitive, check `src/components/ui/`. Duplicating `Button`, `Container` or `SectionHeading` across pages is the failure mode this architecture exists to prevent.

**Styling**

- Tailwind utilities in JSX. Use `cn()` (`clsx` + `tailwind-merge`) for conditional classes.
- Component-specific variants go through `cva` (class-variance-authority), not string concatenation.
- Bespoke keyframes live in `src/styles/animations.css`, not inline.
- Never use `style={{}}` except for genuinely dynamic runtime values (a computed transform, a CSS custom property carrying a data-driven value).

**Accessibility floor** (WCAG 2.1 AA is not a formal client requirement, but these are non-optional quality gates)

- Every interactive element is keyboard reachable with a visible focus ring.
- Every image has meaningful `alt`, or `alt=""` if decorative.
- Every animation respects `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`.
- Heading levels are sequential. One `<h1>` per page.

**Git**

- Branch: `feat/<tracker-id>-<slug>`, e.g. `feat/FE-04-homepage`, cut from `main`.
- Commit: Conventional Commits — `feat(homepage): add hero carousel`.
- One tracker item per PR, merged into `main`. There is no `develop` branch.

## 6. Data layer — read this before touching anything dynamic

The backend is **Spring Boot microservices + MySQL**. **The APIs do not exist yet.** We build against mocks now and cut over later without touching a single component.

```
src/lib/content/
├── types.ts          Domain models (NewsItem, InvestorDocument, TeamMember, …)
├── repository.ts     The ContentRepository interface — the contract
├── mock/
│   ├── index.ts      MockContentRepository
│   └── data/*.json   Fixtures
├── api/
│   ├── index.ts      ApiContentRepository (Spring Boot)
│   └── client.ts     Typed fetch wrapper, Zod-validated
└── index.ts          getContentRepository() — factory
```

**Rules:**

- Components and pages import **only** `getContentRepository()` from `@/lib/content`. Never `@/lib/content/mock` or `@/lib/content/api`.
- The active implementation is selected by the `CONTENT_SOURCE` env var (`mock` | `api`). Default `mock`.
- Adding a new dynamic surface means: add the type → add the method to the interface → implement in **both** mock and api → then build the UI. Never implement only the mock.
- All API responses are validated with Zod at the boundary. A malformed response must degrade to an empty state, not crash the page.
- Forms never post to Spring Boot from the browser. They post to a Next.js route handler under `src/app/api/forms/`, which validates and proxies server-side. This keeps credentials off the client and sidesteps CORS.

## 7. Deployment constraints

The client hosts on an **Azure VM: Nginx terminating TLS in front of PM2 running the Next.js standalone server.** There is no container step — we build the archive and hand it over.

The following are **forbidden**:

- Edge runtime (`export const runtime = 'edge'`)
- Any Vercel-specific API, header or image loader
- Reliance on writable local disk for anything other than Next's own build output and image cache
- ISR (`revalidate` on `generateStaticParams` pages) — a multi-instance host would serve inconsistent caches without a shared cache handler we cannot yet configure

And the following are **required**:

- `output: 'standalone'` in `next.config.ts`
- `pnpm build && pnpm package` must produce an archive that runs via `node server.js` on a bare Node box with no install step and no external services beyond the env vars documented in `.env.example`
- All configuration through environment variables. No hardcoded hostnames.
- Anything Nginx must do that Next does not — compression, TLS, long-cache headers on `/_next/static/` — is captured in `deploy/nginx.conf.sample`. Do not silently rely on a proxy behaviour that is not written down there.

---

## 8. Known constraints and gotchas

- **DIN is a commercially licensed typeface.** Only the files supplied by the client go in `src/assets/fonts/`. Do not substitute a lookalike, and do not fetch DIN from a CDN.
- **The prototype's `uploads/` folder has unstable filenames** (`pasted-1784663527717-0.png` is the logo). Never reference those names. Use the curated names in `docs/asset-inventory.md`.
- **The homepage vision timeline** is a scroll-pinned SVG path animation that only works above `lg`. Below `lg` it is a completely different component. Both are specified in `docs/features/04-homepage.md`. Do not attempt to make one component do both.
- **Careers is not a page we build.** It is a redirect to the client's Oracle recruiting system. See `docs/features/20-career-redirect.md`.
- **Investor PDFs live in Azure Blob Storage**, served via absolute URLs from the backend. Do not commit PDFs to the repo.

## 9. When you are unsure

Ask. Specifically:

- Missing copy or a figure → `{{TODO: content}}` and flag it.
- An API shape that `docs/api-contracts.md` does not cover → propose the contract in your response, add it to that doc, and mock it. Do not silently invent a response shape.
- A design decision the prototype does not answer (almost always: "what does this look like on mobile?") → check `docs/responsive-strategy.md` first; if it is silent, propose an approach and flag it rather than guessing.

# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.
